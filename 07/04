By taking\nadvantage of the unprecedentedly large sample, high S/N ratio and high spectral\nresolution, similarities in the ice profiles from source to source are\nidentified. It is found that excellent fits to all the spectra can be obtained\nusing a phenomenological decomposition of the CO stretching vibration profile\nat 4.67 micron into 3 components. All observed interstellar CO profiles can\nthus be uniquely described by a model depending on only 3 linear fit\nparameters, indicating that a maximum of 3 specific molecular environments of\nsolid CO exist under astrophysical conditions. A simple physical model of the\nCO ice is presented, which shows that the 2139.9 cm-1 component is\nindistinguishable from pure CO ice. It is concluded, that in the majority of\nthe observed lines of sight, 60-90% of the CO is in a nearly pure form. In the\nsame model the 2143.7 cm-1 component can possibly be explained by the\nlongitudinal optical (LO) component of the vibrational transition in pure\ncrystalline CO ice which appears when the background source is linearly\npolarised.

This correspondence was already\nimplicit in the various proofs of the operator sum representation of Completely\nPositive-preserving linear maps; we go further and show that all of the\nimportant theorems concerning quantum operations can be derived directly from\nthose concerning quantum states. As we do so the discussion first provides an\nelegant and original review of the main features of quantum operations. Next\n(in the second half of the paper) we find more results stemming from our\nformulation of the correspondence. Thus we provide a factorizability condition\nfor quantum operations, and give two novel Schmidt-type decompositions of\nbipartite pure states. By translating the composition law of quantum\noperations, we define a group structure upon the set of totally entangled\nstates. The question whether the correspondence is merely mathematical or can\nbe given a physical interpretation is addressed throughout the text: we provide\nformulae which suggest quantum states inherently define a quantum operation\nbetween two of their subsystems, and which turn out to have applications in\nquantum cryptography.
