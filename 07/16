These perturbations\nwill strip outer planets, forming a population of free-floating planets, some\nof which will be tidally captured before they evaporate from the system. For\nsystems with velocity dispersion of 1 km/s, Jupiter-mass planets can be\ncaptured into orbits with periods of 0.1-0.4 days, which are generally stable\nover a Gyr, assuming quadratic suppression of eddy viscosity in the convective\nzones of the host stars. Under this assumption, and that most stars form\nseveral massive planets at separations 5-50 AU, about 0.03% of stars in rich,\nmature open clusters should have extremely close-in tidally captured planets.\nApproximately 0.005% of field stars should also have such planets, which may be\nfound in field searches for transiting planets. Detection of a population of\ntidally-captured planets would indicate that most stars formed in stellar\nclusters. In globular clusters, the fraction of stars with tidally-captured\nplanets rises to 0.1% -- in conflict with the null result of the transit search\nin 47 Tuc. This implies that, if the quadratic prescription for viscosity\nsuppression is correct, planetary formation was inhibited in 47 Tuc: less than\none planet of Jupiter-mass or greater (bound or free-floating) formed per\ncluster star. Less than half of the stars formed solar-system analogs. Brown\ndwarfs can also be captured in tight orbits; the lack of such companions in 47\nTuc in turn implies an upper limit on the initial frequency of brown dwarfs in\nthis cluster. However, this upper limit is extremely sensitive to the highly\nuncertain timescale for orbital decay, and thus it is difficult to draw robust\nconclusions about the low-mass end of the mass function in 47 Tuc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jul 2003 17:58:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

General relativistic\neffects are simulated by using the pseudo-Newtonian potential. We start\ncalculations with a rotating torus threaded by localized poloidal magnetic\nfields with plasma beta, a ratio of the gas pressure to the magnetic pressure,\n$\\beta =10$ and 100. When the bulk of torus material reaches the innermost\nregion close to a central black hole, a magnetically driven jet emerges. This\nmagnetic jet is derived by vertically inflating toroidal fields (`magnetic\ntower') and has a two-component structure: low-$\\beta$ ($\\lsim 1$) plasmas\nthreaded with poloidal (vertical) fields are surrounded by that with toroidal\nfields. The collimation width of the jet depends on external pressure, pressure\nof ambient medium; the weaker the external pressure is, the wider and the\nlonger-lasting becomes the jet. Unless the external pressure is negligible, the\nbipolar jet phase ceases after several dynamical timescales at the original\ntorus position and a subsequent quasi-steady state starts. The black hole is\nsurrounded by quasi-spherical zone with highly inhomogeneous structure in which\ntoroidal fields are dominant except near the rotation axis. Mass accretion\ntakes place mainly along the equatorial plane. Comparisons with other MHD\nsimulation results and observational implications are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jul 2003 07:55:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Nov 2003 11:26:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

In\nthe solution, each large colloid (macroion) attracts certain number of\noppositely charged small colloids ($Z$-ion) to form a complex. If the\nconcentration ratio of the two colloids is such that complexes are not strongly\ncharged, they condense in a macroscopic aggregate. As a result, the phase\ndiagram in a plane of concentrations of two colloids consists of an aggregation\ndomain sandwiched between two domains of stable solutions of complexes.

In these systems, the zigzag antiferromagnetic\nordering, combined with the double-exchange physics, effectively divides the\nwhole sample into the one-dimensional ferromagnetic zigzag chains and results\nin the anisotropy of electronic properties. The electronic structure of one\nsuch chain is described by an effective 3$\\times$3 Hamiltonian in the basis of\nMn($3de_g$) orbitals. We treat this problem analytically and consider the\nfollowing properties: (i) the nearest-neighbor magnetic interactions; (ii) the\ndistribution of the Mn($3de_g$) and Mn($4p$) states near the Fermi level, and\ntheir contribution to the optical conductivity and the resonant x-ray\nscattering near the Mn $K$-absorption edge. We argue that the anisotropy of\nmagnetic interactions in the double-exchange limit, combined with the isotropic\nsuperexchange interactions, readily explains both the local and the global\nstability of the zigzag antiferromagnetic state. The two-fold degeneracy of\n$e_g$ levels plays a very important role in the problem and explains the\ninsulating behavior of the zigzag chain, as well as the appearance of the\norbital ordering in the double-exchange model. Importantly, however, the charge\nordering itself is expected to play only a minor role and is incompatible with\nthe ferromagnetic coupling within the chain.
