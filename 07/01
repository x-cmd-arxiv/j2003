This definition is thus\nnon local and makes analytical predictions difficult, so we propose a local\napproximation: the local skeleton is given by the set of points where the\ngradient is aligned with the local curvature major axis and where the second\ncomponent of the local curvature is negative.\n  We perform a statistical analysis of the length of the total local skeleton,\nchosen for simplicity as the set of all points of space where the gradient is\neither parallel or orthogonal to the main curvature axis.

Access to this data is needed by hundreds\nof physics applications distributed worldwide. In order to meet the demands of\nthese applications from scarce resources, we have created a distributed system\nthat isolates the user applications from the database facilities. This system,\nknown as the Database Application Network (DAN) operates as the middle tier in\na three tier architecture. A DAN server employs a hierarchical caching scheme\nand database connection management facility that limits access to the database\nresource. The modular design allows for caching strategies and database access\ncomponents to be determined by runtime configuration. To solve scalability\nproblems, a proxy database component allows for DAN servers to be arranged in a\nhierarchy. Also included is an event based monitoring system that is currently\nbeing used to collect statistics for performance analysis and problem\ndiagnosis. DAN servers are currently implemented as a Python multithreaded\nprogram using CORBA for network communications and interface specification. The\nrequirement details, design, and implementation of DAN are discussed along with\noperational experience and future plans.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jul 2003 02:13:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Part of the difficulty lies in the fact that we do not\npossess yet a clear-cut understanding of the hypothesis needed for the\nestablishment of some sort of strong cosmic censorship theorem.

An ensemble of N two-level atoms interacts with a\nquantized cavity field. For all the atoms initially in their ground states, it\nis shown that spin squeezing of both the atoms and the field can be achieved\nprovided the initial state of the cavity field has coherence between number\nstates differing by 2. Most of the discussion is restricted to the case of a\ncavity field initially in a coherent state, but initial squeezed states for the\nfield are also discussed. Optimal conditions for obtaining squeezing are\nobtained. An analytic solution is found that is valid in the limit that the\nnumber of atoms is much greater than unity and is also much larger than the\naverage number of photons, inititally in the coherent state of the cavity\nfield. In this limit, the degree of spin squeezing increases with increasing a,\neven though the field more closely resembles a classical field for which no\nspin squeezing could be achieved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jun 2003 16:06:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Jul 2003 18:13:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Jul 2003 18:14:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
