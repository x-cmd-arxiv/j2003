The approach is based\non the theory of alpha-stable distributions. We show that the non-Gaussian\ndistribution of the intensity fluctuations produced by a generic point source\npopulation -- whose number counts follow a simple power law -- belongs to the\nalpha-stable family of distributions. Even if source counts do not follow a\nsimple power law, we show that the alpha-stable model is still useful in many\nastrophysical scenarios. With the alpha-stable model it is possible to totally\ndescribe the non-Gaussian distribution with a few parameters which are closely\nrelated to the parameters describing the source counts, instead of an infinite\nnumber of moments. Using statistical tools available in the signal processing\nliterature, we show how to estimate these parameters in an easy and fast way.\nWe demonstrate that the model proves valid when applied to realistic point\nsource number counts at microwave frequencies. In the case of point\nextragalactic sources observed at CMB frecuencies, our technique is able to\nsuccessfully fitting the P(D) distribution of deflections and to precisely\ndetermining the main parameters which describe the number counts.

We find that the overlap between the target pattern and the state of\nthe network at $t=1$ is independent of the symmetry of the additional random\npart of the synaptic interaction matrix. The result may have bearing on the\ntheories which use the results at $t=1$ to estimate quantities relevant to the\nretrieval performance of the network. The symmetry of the synaptic interaction\nmatrix becomes effective from the second time step, explicitly through a\ncorrelation function involving spin configurations at different times.

Moreover, the convergence time for the retrieval\nincreases. These results are contrary to the expectations from the earlier\nstudies based on the counting of fixed points. However, the convergence time\nfor the spurious fixed points increases faster than that for the retrieval\nfixed points in the presence of asymmetry in the synapses.

In addition to the opaqueness naturally caused by transverse flow, we\nintroduce an extrinsic opacity by imposing restrictions on the pion emission\nangle. Comparing the HBT radii obtained from the normal Cooper-Frye\nprescription and the opaque emission prescription, we find that\n$R_{\\text{out}}/R_{\\text{side}}$ is less than unity only for small values of\nthe transverse momentum with an opaque source. However, HBT radii for large\nvalues of the transverse momentum are dominated by the transverse flow effect\nand are affected less by the source opaqueness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jul 2003 10:36:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Jul 2003 12:01:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 Jul 2003 09:05:47 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 3 Jan 2004 12:45:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

These problems\nare centered on the problematic relation between the quantum and classical\nworlds. The most famous element is the measurement problem, i.e., the\nmeasurement of a quantum system by a classical apparatus, and the concomitant\nphenomena of wave packet reduction, the appearance of probability, and the\nproblems related to Schr\\\"odinger cat states. A fundamental question in this\ncontext is whether quantum mechanics can bootstrap itself to the classical\nworld: is quantum mechanics self-consistent, such that the measurement process\ncan be understood within quantum mechanics itself, or does this process require\nadditional elements from the realm outside of traditional quantum mechanics?\nHere, we point to a problematic aspect in the traditional Schr\\\"odinger cat\nargument which can be overcome through its extension with a proper macroscopic\npreparation device; the deliberate creation of a cat state and its\nidentification then turns into a non-trivial problem requiring the\ndetermination of the evolution of a quantum system entangled with a macroscopic\nreservoir.
