Starting from a few hundred solar masses, a dominant fragment\nwill grow to the isolation mass, which is a significant fraction of the disk\nmass, more quickly than the fragment contracts onto the stellar main sequence.\nA gap will form in the disk and the star will migrate inward on the accretion\ntimescale, which is comparable to the star's main sequence lifetime. By\ninterrupting the gas supply to the inner disk, the gap may temporarily dim and\nredden the quasar. The final stages of stellar migration will be a strong\nsource of low-frequency gravitational waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jul 2003 01:27:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Feb 2004 01:06:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Recently a manifestly 3-dimensional theory was constructed\nwith conformal superspace as the configuration space. Here a fully\n4-dimensional action is constructed so as to be invariant under conformal\ntransformations of the 4-metric using general relativity as a guide. This\naction is then decomposed to a (3+1)-dimensional form and from this to its\nJacobi form. The surprising thing is that the new theory turns out to be\nprecisely the original 3-dimensional theory. The physical data is identified\nand used to find the physical representation of the theory. In this\nrepresentation the theory is extremely similar to general relativity.

It has been shown that all two-body Hamiltonian\nevolutions can be simulated using \\emph{any} fixed two-body entangling\n$n$-qubit Hamiltonian and fast local unitaries. By \\emph{entangling} we mean\nthat every qubit is coupled to every other qubit, if not directly, then\nindirectly via intermediate qubits. We extend this study to the case where\ninteractions may involve more than two qubits at a time. We find necessary and\nsufficient conditions for an arbitrary $n$-qubit Hamiltonian to be\n\\emph{dynamically universal}, that is, able to simulate any other Hamiltonian\nacting on $n$ qubits, possibly in an inefficient manner. We prove that an\nentangling Hamiltonian is dynamically universal if and only if it contains at\nleast one coupling term involving an \\emph{even} number of interacting qubits.\nFor \\emph{odd} entangling Hamiltonians, i.e., Hamiltonians with couplings that\ninvolve only an odd number of qubits, we prove that dynamic universality is\npossible on an encoded set of $n-1$ logical qubits. We further prove that an\nodd entangling Hamiltonian can simulate any other odd Hamiltonian and classify\nthe algebras that such Hamiltonians generate. Thus, our results show that up to\nlocal unitary operations, there are only two fundamentally different types of\nentangling Hamiltonian on $n$ qubits. We also demonstrate that, provided the\nnumber of qubits directly coupled by the Hamiltonian is bounded above by a\nconstant, our techniques can be made efficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jul 2003 07:52:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
