In the presence of a massive dark-matter halo, the density-wave\ndynamics on galactic scales involves the stellar disk, the gas disk of\ninterstellar medium (ISM), the magnetic field, and the cosmic-ray gas (CRG). In\nthis paper, we explore the dynamic and electromagnetic interplay between the\nmagnetized ISM disk and CRG disk so that structural and diagnostic features of\noptical, infrared, and synchrotron radio-continuum emissions from a spiral\ngalaxy can be physically understood. On timescales of galactic density waves,\ncosmic rays collectively may be treated as a relativistically hot tenuous gas\nfluid that is tied to the large-scale mean magnetic field in transverse bulk\nmotions but moves otherwise differently along the magnetic field relative to\nthe ISM. For both fast and slow magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) density waves in a\ncomposite disk system of magnetized ISM and CRG, the minute CRG mass density\nenhancement is phase shifted relative to the enhancement of parallel magnetic\nfield. Owing to an extremely small number of cosmic rays, the large-scale\nmagnetic field enhancement dominates in synchrotron radio-continuum emissions\n(as if the CRG is almost unperturbed) for spiral structural manifestations. In\naddition to the fast and slow MHD density waves, there also exists a\nsuprathermal MHD wave mode by which CRG adjusts itself with an effective\nsuprathermal sound speed close to the speed of light c.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Jul 2003 08:05:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We explore several options for the geometry and\nphysical form of the emitting and absorbing gas. The lack of change in\nionization in the absorber despite an increase in continuum flux during the\nobservation restricts the high-ionization (O-K) and the low-ionization (Fe-M)\ngas to distances of at least 0.5 pc and 2.8 pc, respectively, away from the\ncentral source. Given the P-Cygni type profiles in the resonance spectral lines\nand the similar velocity widths, column densities, and ionization structure\ninferred separately from the emission and absorption lines, it is tempting to\nrelate the X-ray narrow-line emitting plasma with the X-ray absorbing gas.\nUnder this assumption, the scenario of dense clumped clouds can be ruled out.\nConversely, extended ionization cones (r > 10 pc) are consistent with the\nobservation independent of this assumption. These findings are in stark\ncontrast with the picture of numerous clumpy (n_e > 10^9 cm^-3) clouds drawn\nrecently from UV spectra, but it is consistent with the extended X-ray emission\ncones observed directly in Seyfert 2 galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Jul 2003 11:05:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

For fixed k we study the value distribution of\nc_n(k) (following A. Wintner) and a_n(k) (partly following H. Moller). In\nparticular we disprove a 1970 conjecture of H. Moller on the average (over n)\nof a_n(k).\n  We show that certain symmetric functions in primitive roots considered by the\nDence brothers are related to the behaviour of c_{p-1}(k) and a_{p-1}(k) as p\nranges over the primes and study their value distribution as well.\n  This paper is an outgrowth of the M.Sc. thesis project of the second author,\ncarried out under the supervision of the first author at the Korteweg-de Vries\nInstitute (University of Amsterdam) and is written in M.Sc. thesis style.\n  We gratefully acknowledge numerical assistance by Yves Gallot.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Jul 2003 13:15:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Muon capture\nrates, $\\lambda_\\mathrm{cap}^p (\\Delta E_p)$ and $\\lambda_\\mathrm{cap}^d\n(\\Delta E_d)$ are obtained using two different analysis methods.
