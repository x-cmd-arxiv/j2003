As string quantization on general backgrounds with fluxes is\nvery difficult, one often uses the duality at the level of canonical fields of\nsupergravity and the corresponding half-BPS operators in SYM, since they both\nbelong to the shortest multiplets of the superconformal group SU(2,2|4). In\naddition to half-BPS operators, there are others with non-renormalization\nproperties. One such class of operators is the quarter-BPS operators, which are\ndual to threshold bound states of elementary supergravity excitations. Their\nscaling dimension is also determined by their internal quantum numbers.\nExtended superspace methods make it simple to identify and remove descendant\npieces from quarter-BPS candidates. We also compute three-point functions\ninvolving quarter-BPS operators, and explain how their non-renormalization\ntranslates into statements about the dual supergravity quantities. But we can\ngo beyond discussing protected operators. The GS superstring on AdS(5) x S(5)\ncan be quantized exactly in the limit where the AdS(5) radius R goes to\ninfinity and the R-charge J scales like R^2. BMN states are then dual to single\ntrace operators with certain phases inserted (BMN operators). BMN operators are\nanother natural generalization of half-BPS operators. The perturbative\nexpansion of scaling dimensions of BMN operators is in powers of gN/J^2.\nMoreover, one can do perturbation theory around the infinite R, J ~ R^2 limit.\nBoth expansions have the same regime of validity in string theory and in SYM.\nWe calculate the first 1/R^2 and 1/J corrections, and find complete agreement\nbetween the dual quantities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jul 2003 00:35:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Plasma pressure, in turn, determines - within the framework of a\ngiven magnetic field model - the density of bulk currents in the magnetosphere.\nWith a knowledge of the bulk currents as a function of coordinates, we can\ncalculate the field-aligned currents as a divergence of bulk currents. On the\nother hand, specifying the convection model is equivalent to specifying the\nelectric field model. Since within the approximation of equipotential field\nlines the electric field is common to the magnetosphere and ionosphere, bulk\ncurrents and field-aligned currents in the ionosphere can be formally\ncalculated subject to the condition that ionospheric conductivity is wholly\ndetermined by electron precipitation from the magnetosphere.

This brings up the question: How can\nthese two systems of field-aligned currents be reconciled?

We find that at\nthe SU(2) point, the ground state possess the maximum concurrence. When the\nanisotropic parameter $\\Delta$ is deformed, however, its value decreases. Its\ndependence on $\\Delta$ scales as $C=C_0-C_1(\\Delta-1)^2$ in the XY metallic\nphase and near the critical point (i.e. $1<\\Delta<1.3$) of the Ising-like\ninsulating phase. We also study the dependence of $C$ on the correlation length\n$\\xi$, and show that it satisfies $C=C_0-1/2\\xi$ near the critical point. For\ndifferent size of the system, we show that there exists a universal scaling\nfunction of $C$ with respect to the correlation length $\\xi$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jul 2003 07:49:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 5 Oct 2003 09:32:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

For a large\nnumber of qubits, explicit formulae for the concurrences, measures for\ntwo-qubit entanglements, and the fidelity for recovering the state some\ndistance away are calculated as functions of time. Initial states with an\nentangled pair of qubits show better fidelity, which takes its first maximum\nvalue at earlier times, compared to initial states with no entangled pair.
