For reception the stable\nmodel of the nonlinear medium are used methods of the linear prediction and\nprogressive approximation. By modeling was determined that depending on ratio\nof velocities of the solitons and the form of highest derivatives balance is\npossible self-organization of the medium nonequilibrium state as formation of\nshock waves and stable on the form solitary waves, created as a result of full\nor partial mutual penetration of the solitons. Is possible also aggregation of\nthe solitons in third wave. The shock waves can pass into other possible\nresonance state as a wave front with stable amplitude, which precedes\ndeveloping in singularity negative front.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jul 2003 15:45:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
