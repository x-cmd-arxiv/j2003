Observations of D/H can limit or\nmeasure the true primordial abundance because D is thought to be destroyed by\nstars and thus D/H monotonically decreases after BBN. Recently, however, Mullan\n& Linsky have pointed out that D arises as a secondary product of neutrons in\nstellar flares which then capture on protons via n+p \\to d + gamma, and that\nthis could dominate over direct D production in flares. Mullan & Linsky note\nthat if this process is sufficiently vigorous in flaring dwarf stars, it could\nlead to significant non-BBN D production.

Within dark matter\nhalos, forming at the rate predicted by the canonical hierarchical clustering\nscenario, the gas evolution is controlled by gravity, radiative cooling, and\nheating by feedback from supernovae and from the growing active nucleus.\nSupernova heating is increasingly effective with decreasing binding energy in\nslowing down the star formation and in driving gas outflows. The more massive\nproto-galaxies virializing at earlier times are thus the sites of the faster\nstar-formation. The correspondingly higher radiation drag fastens the angular\nmomentum loss by the gas, resulting in a larger accretion rate onto the central\nblack-hole. In turn, the kinetic energy carried by outflows driven by active\nnuclei can unbind the residual gas, thus halting both the star formation and\nthe black-hole growth, in a time again shorter for larger halos. For the most\nmassive galaxies the gas unbinding time is short enough for the bulk of the\nstar-formation to be completed before type Ia supernovae can substantially\nincrease the $Fe$ abundance of the interstellar medium, thus accounting for the\n$\\alpha$-enhancement seen in the largest galaxies.

In\nparticular, we focus on the effects of history on the relaxation of the excess\nconductance dG. The natural relaxation law of dG is logarithmic, namely\ndG=-log(t). This may be observed over more than five decades following, for\nexample, cool-quenching the sample from high temperatures. On the other hand,\nwhen the system is excited from a state S_{o} in which it has not fully reached\nequilibrium to a state S_{n}, the ensuing relaxation law is logarithmic only\nover time t shorter than the time t_{w} it spent in S_{o}. For times t>t_{w}\ndG(t) show systematic deviation from the logarithmic dependence. It was\npreviously shown that when the energy imparted to the system in the excitation\nprocess is small, this leads to dG=P(t/t_{w}) (simple-aging). Here we test the\nconjecture that `simple-aging' is related to a symmetry in the relaxation\ndynamics in S_{o} and S_{n}. This is done by using a new experimental procedure\nthat is more sensitive to deviations in the relaxation dynamics. It is shown\nthat simple-aging may still be obeyed (albeit with a modified P(t/t_{w})) even\nwhen the symmetry of relaxation in S_{o} and S_{n} is perturbed by a certain\ndegree.

This method allows us\nto survey various statistical measures for the partition sum. The role of the\nstatistical measures is arousing much attention, since Pinnow and Helfrich\nclaimed that under a suitable statistical measure, that is, the local mean\ncurvature, the fluid membranes are stiffened, rather than softened, by thermal\nundulations. In this paper, we propose an efficient method to observe the\neffective bending moduli directly: We subjected a fluid membrane to a curved\nreference plane, and from the free-energy cost due to the reference-plane\ndeformations, we read off the effective bending moduli. Accepting the\nmean-curvature measure, we found that the effective bending rigidity gains even\nin the case of very flexible membrane (small bare rigidity); it has been rather\ncontroversial that for such non-perturbative regime, the analytical prediction\ndoes apply. We also incorporate the Gaussian-curvature modulus, and calculated\nits effective rigidity. Thereby, we found that the effective Gaussian-curvature\nmodulus stays almost scale-invariant. All these features are contrasted with\nthe results under the normal-displacement measure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jul 2003 11:12:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The isolated top quark signature, unbalanced by any other heavy\nparticle, should help to identify the potential FCNC events much more than any\nother final state. We compute the maximum branching ratios and the number of\nFCNC Higgs boson decay events at the LHC collider at CERN. The most favorable\nmode for production and subsequent FCNC decay is the lightest CP-even state in\nthe Type II 2HDM, followed by the other CP-even state, if it is not very heavy,\nwhereas the CP-odd mode can never be sufficiently enhanced. Our calculation\nshows that the branching ratios of the CP-even states may reach 10^{-5}, and\nthat several hundred events could be collected in the highest luminosity runs\nof the LHC. We also point out some strategies to use these FCNC decays as a\nhandle to discriminate between 2HDM and supersymmetric Higgs bosons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jul 2003 12:24:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 26 Jul 2003 17:43:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 3 Oct 2003 12:55:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-05"}

The gauge fields naturally appear as a\nnew geometric contribution to the total variation of the scale variables. The\ngauge charges emerge as the generators of the scale transformation group\napplied to a generalized action (now identified with the scale relativistic\ninvariant) and are therefore the conservative quantities which find their\norigin in the symmetries of the scale-space.

In this paper we investigate this\nquestion using the modal (hidden variable) interpretation of quantum mechanics.\nWe find that the noise function $z(t)$ appearing in the non-Markovian SSE can\nbe interpreted as a hidden variable for the environment. That is, some chosen\nproperty (beable) of the environment has a definite value $z(t)$ even in the\nabsence of measurement on the environment. The non-Markovian SSE gives the\nevolution of the state of the system ``conditioned'' on this environment hidden\nvariable. We present the theory for diffusive non-Markovian SSEs that have as\ntheir Markovian limit SSEs corresponding to homodyne and heterodyne detection,\nas well as one which has no Markovian limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jul 2003 11:26:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Dec 2003 22:33:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 14 Apr 2007 04:12:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The energy variation of the classical periodicity ($\\tau$) is\nalso dramatic, having the special limiting case of $\\tau \\to \\infty$ at the\n'top' of the classical motion (i.e. the separatrix.) We study the\ntime-dependence of the quantum pendulum problem, focusing on the behavior of\nboth the (approximate) classical periodicity and especially the quantum revival\nand superrevival times, as encoded in the energy eigenvalue spectrum of the\nsystem. We provide approximate expressions for the energy eigenvalues in both\nthe small and large quantum number limits, up to 4th order in perturbation\ntheory, comparing these to existing handbook expansions for the characteristic\nvalues of the related Mathieu equation, obtained by other methods. We then use\nthese approximations to probe the classical periodicity, as well as to extract\ninformation on the quantum revival and superrevival times. We find that while\nboth the classical and quantum periodicities increase monotonically as one\napproaches the 'top' in energy, from either above or below, the revival times\ndecrease from their low- and high-energy values until very near the separatrix\nwhere they increase to a large, but finite value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jul 2003 12:16:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
