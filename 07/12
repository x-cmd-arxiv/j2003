The relativistic hydrostatic equilibrium equation, i.e., the\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation, is modified in order to include electric\ncharge. We perform a detailed numerical study of the effect of electric charge\nusing a polytropic equation of state. We conclude that in order to see any\nappreciable effect on the phenomenology of the compact stars, the electric\nfields have to be huge (~ 10^{21} V/m), which implies that the total charge is\nQ ~ 10^{20} Coulomb. From the local effect of the forces experienced on a\nsingle charged particle, it is expected that each individual charged particle\nis quickly ejected from the star. This in turn produces a huge force imbalance,\nand the gravitational force overwhelms the repulsive Coulomb and fluid pressure\nforces. The star can then collapse to form a charged black hole before all the\ncharge leaves the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Jul 2003 00:07:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Aug 2003 22:49:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We\nassume that strong interactions impose a short-range periodicicity of the\nelectron positions. The long-range order of such an electron crystal (or\nequivalently, a $4 k_F$ charge-density wave) is destroyed by impurities. The 3D\narray of chains behaves differently at large and at small impurity\nconcentrations $N$. At large $N$, impurities divide the chains into metallic\nrods. The low-temperature conductivity is due to the variable-range hopping of\nelectrons between the rods. It obeys the Efros-Shklovskii (ES) law and\nincreases exponentially as $N$ decreases. When $N$ is small, the metallic-rod\npicture of the ground state survives only in the form of rare clusters of\natypically short rods. They are the source of low-energy charge excitations. In\nthe bulk the charge excitations are gapped and the electron crystal is pinned\ncollectively. A strongly anisotropic screening of the Coulomb potential\nproduces an unconventional linear in energy Coulomb gap and a new law of the\nvariable-range hopping $-\\ln\\sigma \\sim (T_1 / T)^{2/5}$. $T_1$ remains\nconstant over a finite range of impurity concentrations. At smaller $N$ the\n2/5-law is replaced by the Mott law, where the conductivity gets suppressed as\n$N$ goes down. Thus, the overall dependence of $\\sigma$ on $N$ is nonmonotonic.\nIn 1D, the granular-rod picture and the ES apply at all $N$. The conductivity\ndecreases exponentially with $N$.

The optimal axonal and dendritic\nvolume fractions are not significantly different from anatomical measurements\nin the mouse and rat neocortex, and the rat hippocampus. This has led us to\npropose that the maximization of information storage capacity associated with\ndendritic spine remodeling may have been an important driving force in the\nevolution of the cortex.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jul 2003 21:25:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Although the solar storm\nelectric field is lower than MHD EMP, the solar storm effects are generally\ngreater due to their much longer duration.
