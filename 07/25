Such relationships provide us with a mechanism for\ncounting open string states in situations where the physical spectrum\ncalculation is nearly intractable -- after translating to mathematics, such\ncalculations become easy. We describe several different approaches to these\nmodels, and also describe how these models are changed by varying physical\ncircumstances -- flat B field backgrounds, orbifolds, and nonzero Higgs vevs.\nWe also discuss mathematical interpretations of operator products, and how such\nmathematical interpretations can be checked physically. One of the motivations\nfor this work is to understand the precise physical relationship between\nboundary states in the open string B model and derived categories in\nmathematics, and we outline what is currently known of the relationship.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jul 2003 16:11:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Aug 2003 16:18:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We discuss spin and quantum\ndot cellular automata for their importance in experimental realizations and\ntheir use in quantum computation.
