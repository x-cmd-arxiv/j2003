One of the most metal-deficient blue compact galaxies (BCGs) HS\n0822+3542 (Z=1/34 Zsun), is also one of the nearest such objects. A trigger\nmechanism for its current SF burst has remained unclear. We report the\ndiscovery of a very blue ((B-V)tot=0.08 and (V-R)tot=0.14) LSB (mu_B^0 > 23.4\narcsec^-2) dwarf irregular (dIrr) galaxy, named SAO 0822+3545. Its small\nrelative velocity and projected distance of ~11 kpc from the BCG imply their\nphysical association. For this LSB galaxy, we present spectroscopic results,\ntotal B,V,R magnitudes, the effective radii and surface brightness (SB), and we\ndescribe its morphological properties. We compare the very blue colours of this\ndwarf with PEGASE.2 models of the colour evolution of a Z=1/20 Zsun stellar\npopulation, and combine this analysis with the data on the LSBD EW(Ha) values.\nThe models best describing all available observational data depend on the\nrelative fraction of massive stars in the IMF used. For a Salpeter IMF with Mup\n= 120 Msun, the best model includes a \"young\" single stellar population (SSP)\nwith an age of ~10 Myr and an \"old\" SSP with the age of ~0.2--10 Gyr.

In recent years, there\nhas been much work on axiomatic characterizations of belief change. We claim\nthat a better understanding of belief change can be gained from examining\nappropriate semantic models. In this paper we propose a general framework in\nwhich to model belief change. We begin by defining belief in terms of knowledge\nand plausibility: an agent believes p if he knows that p is more plausible than\nits negation. We then consider some properties defining the interaction between\nknowledge and plausibility, and show how these properties affect the properties\nof belief. In particular, we show that by assuming two of the most natural\nproperties, belief becomes a KD45 operator. Finally, we add time to the\npicture. This gives us a framework in which we can talk about knowledge,\nplausibility (and hence belief), and time, which extends the framework of\nHalpern and Fagin for modeling knowledge in multi-agent systems. We then\nexamine the problem of ``minimal change''. This notion can be captured by using\nprior plausibilities, an analogue to prior probabilities, which can be updated\nby ``conditioning''. We show by example that conditioning on a plausibility\nmeasure can capture many scenarios of interest. In a companion paper, we show\nhow the two best-studied scenarios of belief change, belief revisionand belief\nupdate, fit into our framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jul 2003 21:36:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The advantage of the\napproach is that the \"coarse model\" (the continuum, effective equation) need\nnot be explicitly constructed. The method only uses a time-integration code for\nthe discrete problem and judicious choices of initial data and integration\ntimes; our bifurcation computations are based on the so-called Recursive\nProjection Method (RPM) with arc-length continuation (Shroff and Keller, 1993).\nThe technique is used to monitor features of the genuinely discrete problem\nsuch as the pinning of coherent structures and its results are compared to\nquasi-continuum approaches such as the ones based on Pade approximations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jul 2003 19:58:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In order to put the theory in a proper\nhistorical perspective, the approach devised in quantum field theory is rapidly\npresented, showing how it implies a kind of duality in perturbation theory,\nfrom the start. The approach of renormalization group in perturbation theory is\nthen presented. This method permits to resum secularities in perturbation\ntheory and makes fully algorithmical the resummation, transforming the\nperturbation calculations in a step by step computational procedure. The\ngeneral theorem on which is founded a proper application of the strong coupling\nexpansion, based on a result in the quantum adiabatic theory, is then exposed.\nThis theorem gives the leading order of a strong coupling expansion. Then,\nafter the introduction of the principle of duality in perturbation theory that\nputs in a proper context the quantum field theory method, the resulting theory\nof the strong coupling expansion and the free picture are presented. An\nalgorithm for the computation of the perturbation series is finally given. This\napproach has a lot of applications in fields as quantum optics, condensed\nmatter and so on, extending the original expectations of the quantum field\ntheory method. So, we give some examples of application for a class of\ntwo-level systems that, in recent years, proved to be extremely important. One\nof the most interesting concepts that can be obtained in this way is that of a\nQuantum Amplifier (QAMP) that permits to obtain an amplification to the\nclassical level of the quantum fluctuations of the ground state of a single\nradiation mode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jul 2003 14:08:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
