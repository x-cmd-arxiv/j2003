Our results show that the\ncomoving density of star formation rate, determined from the UV luminosity\ndensity of sources in the HDFN, increases monotonically with redshift out to at\nleast redshift of 5. This behavior can plausibly be explained by a smooth\nincrease of the UV luminosity density with redshift coupled with an increase in\nthe number of star forming regions as a function of redshift. We also find that\nthe information contained in individual pixels in a galaxy can be linked to its\nmorphological history.

This SCDW model\nis applied to analyses of multistep direct processes in\n$^{12}$C$(p,p^{\\prime}x)$, $^{40}$Ca$(p,p^{\\prime}x)$ and\n$^{90}$Zr$(p,p^{\\prime}x)$ in the incident energy range of 150--392 MeV. The\ndouble differential cross sections are calculated up to three-step processes.\nThe calculated angular distributions are in good agreement with the\nexperimental data, in particular at backward angles where the previous SCDW\ncalculations with the WS single-particle wave function showed large\nunderestimation. It is found that the result with the Wigner distribution\nfunction based on the coherent density fluctuation model provides overall\nbetter agreement with the experimental data over the whole emission energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jul 2003 05:42:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
