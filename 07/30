Since such estimators require\nrequire of order N_d^3 operations they are computationally prohibitive for N_d\ngreater than a few tens of thousands. Because of this, a large and\ninhomogeneous literature exists on approximate methods of power spectrum\nestimation. These range from manifestly sub-optimal, but computationally fast\nmethods, to near optimal but computationally expensive methods. Furthermore,\nmuch of this literature concentrates on the power spectrum estimates rather\nthan the equally important problem of deriving an accurate covariance matrix.\nIn this paper, I consider the problem of estimating the power spectrum of\ncosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies from large data sets. Various\nanalytic results on power spectrum estimators are derived, or collated from the\nliterature, and tested against numerical simulations. An unbiased hybrid\nestimator is proposed that combines a maximum likelihood estimator at low\nmultipoles and pseudo-C_\\ell estimates at high multipoles. The hybrid estimator\nis computationally fast, nearly optimal over the full range of multipoles, and\nreturns an accurate and nearly diagonal covariance matrix for realistic\nexperimental configurations (provided certain conditions on the noise\nproperties of the experiment are satisfied). It is argued that, in practice,\ncomputationally expensive methods that approximate the N_d^3 maximum likelihood\nsolution are unlikely to improve on the hybrid estimator, and may actually\nperform worse.

Such calculations allow for direct simulation of observable\nquantities for complex afterglows with arbitrary energy distributions and\nlateral expansion paradigms. A simple, causal model is suggested for lateral\nexpansion of the jet as it evolves; namely, that the lateral expansion kinetic\nenergy derives from the forward kinetic energy. As such the homogeneous jet\nmodel shows that lateral expansion is important at all times in the afterglow\nevolution and that analytical scaling laws do a poor job at describing the\nafterglow decay before and after the break. In particular, I find that lateral\nexpansion does not cause a break in the lightcurve as had been predicted. A\nprimary purpose of this paper is to study structured afterglows, which do a\ngood job of reproducing global relationships and correlations in the data and\nthus suggest the possibility of a universal afterglow model. Simulations of\nstructured jets show a general trend in which jet breaks become more pronounced\nwith increasing viewing angle with respect to the jet axis. In fact, under\ncertain conditions a bump can occur in the lightcurve at the jet break time. I\nderive scaling relations for this bump and suggest that it may be a source of\nsome bumps in observed lightcurves such as that of GRB 000301C. A couple of\nlateral expansion models are tested over a range of efficiencies and viewing\nangles and it is found that lateral expansion can, in some cases, substantially\nsharpen the jet break.

To investigate the features of the low-lying excited manifolds, the\nintramolecular exchange interactions are calculated using density-functional\ntheory (DFT). With the calculated exchange parameters, the energy gap between\nthe S=10 ground-state and the first excited-state manifold is calculated by\ndiagonalization of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian. The upper limit on the energy\ngap is about 40.5 K which is likely to be overestimated due to incomplete\ntreatment of the Coulomb potential within DFT.

First, a rigorous mathematical model is proposed of emergent\ncharacter, which is conceptually bonded with Quantum Mechanics while apparently\nnon-derivable from the many-body Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation. I call the resulting\nconceptual framework the Mesoscopic Mechanics (MeM). Its formulation is\nspace-independent and comprises a nonlinear and holistic extension of the free\nelectron model.

In particular, I\npostulate a probabilistic interpretation, and indicate how the theory could be\napplied and verified by experiment.\n  The Mesoscopic Mechanics proposed here has been deduced from the Nonlinear\nMaxwell Theory (NMT)--a classical in character nonlinear field theory. This\nlatter theory has already been shown to provide a consistent phenomenological\nmodel of such phenomena as superconductivity, charge stripes, magnetic vortex\nlattice, and magnetic oscillations. The NMT, which arose from geometric\nconsiderations, has long been awaiting an explanation as to its ties with the\nfundamental principles.

This can be obtained in terms of a functional W[f,S] of the field f on\na closed 3d surface S that bounds a finite region R of Minkowski spacetime. The\ndependence of W on S is governed by a local covariant generalization of the\nSchroedinger equation. Particles' scattering amplitudes that describe\nexperiments conducted in the finite region R --the lab during a finite time--\ncan be expressed in terms of W. The dependence of W on the geometry of S\nexpresses the dependence of the transition amplitudes on the relative location\nof the particle detectors. In a gravitational theory, background independence\nimplies that W is independent from S. However, the detectors' relative location\nis still coded in the argument of W, because the geometry of the boundary\nsurface is determined by the boundary value f of the gravitational field. This\nobservation clarifies the physical meaning of the functional W defined by non\nperturbative formulations of quantum gravity, such as the spinfoam formalism.\nIn particular, it suggests a way to derive particles' scattering amplitudes\nfrom a spinfoam model.

Our analysis shows that the consistent\ninclusion of the dynamical spectral function has a significant impact on\nrelaxation phenomena. The different time scales, that are involved in the\ndynamical quantum evolution towards a complete thermalized state, are discussed\nin detail. We find that far off-shell 1 <-> 3 processes are responsible for\nchemical equilibration, which is missed in the Boltzmann limit. Finally, we\naddress briefly the case of (bare) massless fields. For sufficiently large\ncouplings $\\lambda$ we observe the onset of Bose condensation, where our scheme\nwithin symmetric \\phi^4-theory breaks down.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jul 2003 17:23:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We consider an exactly soluble one-dimensional\nmodel, with a spatially localized delta-type coupling between the atoms in the\ntrap and a continuum of free-particle external modes. Two important special\ncases are considered for the confinement potential: the infinite box and the\nharmonic oscillator. We establish that in both cases a bound state of the\ncoupled system appears for any value of the coupling constant, implying that\nthe trap population does not vanish in the infinite-time limit. For weak\ncoupling, the energy spectrum of the outgoing beam exhibits peaks corresponding\nto the initially occupied energy levels in the trap; the height of these peaks\nincreases with the energy. As the coupling gets stronger, the energy spectrum\nis displaced towards dressed energies of the fermions in the trap. The\ncorresponding dressed states result from the coupling between the unperturbed\nfermionic states in the trap, mediated by the coupling between these states and\nthe continuum. In the strong-coupling limit, there is a reinforcement of the\nlowest-energy dressed mode, which contributes to the energy spectrum of the\noutgoing beam more strongly than the other modes. This effect is especially\npronounced for the one-dimensional box, which indicates that the efficiency of\nthe mode-reinforcement mechanism depends on the steepness of the confinement\npotential. In this case, a quasi-monochromatic anti-bunched atomic beam is\nobtained. Results for a bosonic sample are also shown for comparison.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jul 2003 15:12:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 May 2004 23:42:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
