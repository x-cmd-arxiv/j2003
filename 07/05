A node may decide not to cooperate\nto save its resources while still using the network to relay its traffic. If\ntoo many nodes exhibit this behavior, network performance degrades and\ncooperating nodes may find themselves unfairly loaded. Most previous efforts to\ncounter this behavior have relied on further cooperation between nodes to\nexchange reputation information about other nodes. If a node observes another\nnode not participating correctly, it reports this observation to other nodes\nwho then take action to avoid being affected and potentially punish the bad\nnode by refusing to forward its traffic. Unfortunately, such second-hand\nreputation information is subject to false accusations and requires maintaining\ntrust relationships with other nodes. The objective of OCEAN is to avoid this\ntrust-management machinery and see how far we can get simply by using direct\nfirst-hand observations of other nodes' behavior.
