Recently, Rutledge has shown (Phys. Rev. E63, 021111 (2001))\nthat such problems can be generally expressed in terms of a grand canonical\nensemble of polydisperse particles. Within this framework, one identifies a\npolydisperse attribute (`pseudo-species') $\\sigma$ corresponding to some\nappropriate generalized coordinate of the system to hand. Associated with this\nattribute is a composition distribution $\\bar\\rho(\\sigma)$ measuring the number\nof particles of each species.

Simulation approaches to the inverse\nproblem involve determining the form of $\\mu(\\sigma)$ for which\n$\\bar\\rho(\\sigma)$ matches the available experimental data. The difficulty in\ndoing so is that $\\mu(\\sigma)$ is (in general) an unknown {\\em functional} of\n$\\bar\\rho(\\sigma)$ and must therefore be found by iteration.

In the P matrix, it is proposed to isolate\nexplicitly the background term corresponding to purely Coulomb interaction,\nwhereby it becomes possible to improve convergence of the expansions used and\nto obtain a correct asymptotic behavior of observables at high energies. The\nexpressions for the purely Coulomb background P matrix, its poles and residues,\nand purely Coulomb eigenfunctions of the P-matrix approach are obtained. The\nnuclear-Coulomb low-energy scattering parameters of two charged hadrons are\ninvestigated on the basis of this approach combined with the method of\nisolating the background P matrix.
