This type of noise may result from tiny fluctuations and\ndrift in the parameters of the (quantum) components performing the computation.\nThe resulting operations are still unitary, but not precisely those assumed in\nthe design of the algorithm. Here we focus on the effect of such noise in the\nHadamard gate $W$, which is an essential component in each iteration of the\nquantum search process. To this end $W$ is replaced by a noisy Hadamard gate\n$U$. The parameters of $U$ at each iteration are taken from an arbitrary\nprobability distribution (e.g. Gaussian distribution) and are characterized by\ntheir statistical moments around the parameters of $W$. For simplicity we\nassume that the noise is unbiased and isotropic, namely all noise variables in\nthe parametrization we use have zero average and the same standard deviation\n$\\epsilon$. The noise terms at different calls to $U$ are assumed to be\nuncorrelated. For a search space of size $N=2^n$ (where $n$ is the number of\nqubits used to span this space) it is found that as long as $\\epsilon <\nO(n^{-{1/2}} N^{-{1/4}})$, the algorithm maintains significant efficiency,\nwhile above this noise level its operation is hampered completely. It is also\nfound that below this noise threshold, when the search fails, it is likely to\nprovide a state that differs from the marked state by only a few bits. This\nfeature can be used to search for the marked state by a classical\npost-processing, even if the quantum search has failed, thus improving the\nsuccess rate of the search process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Jul 2003 13:00:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
