The bright radio emission from SN 1998bw indicated\nthat it possessed some of the unique attributes expected of GRBs, namely a\nlarge reservoir of energy in (mildly) relativistic ejecta and variable energy\ninput. The two popular scenarios for the origin of SN 1998bw are a typical\ncosmological burst observed off-axis or a member of a new distinct class of\nsupernova explosions (gSNe). In the former, about 0.5% of local Type Ib/c SNe\nare expected to be similar to SN1998bw; for the latter no such constraint\nexists. Motivated thus, we began a systematic program of radio observations of\nmost reported Type Ib/c SNe accessible to the Very Large Array.
