For the first time, we use the slopes of optical-NIR Kormendy\nrelations to study colour gradients as a function of galaxy size, and we derive\nthe Photometric Plane at z~0.2 in the K band. Colour gradients are negligible\nat optical wavelengths, and are negative in the optical-NIR, implying a\nmetallicity gradient in galaxies of ~0.2 dex per radial decade.

Such a result is not simply accomodated within a\nmonolithic collapse scenario, while it can be well understood within a\nhierarchical merging framework.
