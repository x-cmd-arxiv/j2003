On the other hand, the fraction of globular clusters which contain X-ray\nsources appears to be roughly constant at f_GC-X ~ 4%. There is a strong\ntendency for the X-ray sources to be associated with the optically more\nluminous GCs. However, this correlation is consistent with a constant\nprobability of finding a LMXB per unit optical luminosity; it seems to result\nprimarily from the larger number of stars in optically luminous GCs. The\nprobability of finding a bright LMXB per unit optical luminosity in the GCs is\nabout 1.5e-7 LMXBs per L_solar,I for L_X >~ 1e38 erg/s, and rises to about\n2.0e-7 LMXBs per L_solar,I at lower X-ray luminosities, L_X >~ 3e37 erg/s.

Once such an ionizing source\nturns off, its surrounding HII region Compton cools and recombines.\nNonetheless, we show that the ``fossil'' HII regions left behind remain at high\nadiabats, prohibiting gas accretion and cooling in subsequent generations of\nmini-halos. Thus, early star formation is self-limiting. We quantify this\neffect to show that star formation in mini-halos cannot account for the bulk of\nthe electron scattering opacity measured by WMAP, which must be due to more\nmassive objects.

We discuss several important consequences\nof this early entropy floor for reionization. It reduces gas clumping,\ncurtailing the required photon budget for reionization. An entropy floor also\nprevents H2 formation and cooling, due to reduced gas densities: it greatly\nenhances feedback from UV photodissociation of H2.

A coalition of\nagents can sometimes accomplish things that the individual agents cannot, or\ncan do things more efficiently. However, motivating the agents to abide to a\nsolution requires careful analysis: only some of the solutions are stable in\nthe sense that no group of agents is motivated to break off and form a new\ncoalition. This constraint has been studied extensively in cooperative game\ntheory. However, the computational questions around this constraint have\nreceived less attention. When it comes to coalition formation among software\nagents (that represent real-world parties), these questions become increasingly\nexplicit.\n  In this paper we define a concise general representation for games in\ncharacteristic form that relies on superadditivity, and show that it allows for\nefficient checking of whether a given outcome is in the core.

Generalizing examples such as flat and Schwarzschild\nspace-times, it is proposed that the Penrose conformal factor be a product of\nadvanced and retarded conformal factors, which asymptotically relate physical\nand conformal null (light-like) coordinates and vanish at future and past null\ninfinity respectively, with both vanishing at spatial infinity. A\ncorrespondingly refined definition of asymptotic flatness at both spatial and\nnull infinity is given, including that the conformal boundary is locally a\nlight cone, with spatial infinity as the vertex. It is shown how to choose the\nconformal factors so that this asymptotic light cone is locally a metric light\ncone. The theory is implemented in the spin-coefficient (or null-tetrad)\nformalism by a simple joint transformation of the spin-metric and spin-basis\n(or metric and tetrad). The advanced and retarded conformal factors may be used\nas expansion parameters near the respective null infinity, together with a\ndependent expansion parameter for both spatial and null infinity, essentially\ninverse radius.

We construct a concrete realization of these operators for\nKlein-Gordon fields and show that in this realization PT and C operators\nrespectively correspond to the ordinary time-reversal and charge-grading\noperations. Furthermore, we present a complete description of the quantum\nmechanics of Klein-Gordon fields that is based on the construction of a Hilbert\nspace with a relativistically invariant, positive-definite, and conserved inner\nproduct. In particular we offer a natural construction of a position operator\nand the corresponding localized and coherent states. The restriction of this\nposition operator to the positive-frequency fields coincides with the\nNewton-Wigner operator. Our approach does not rely on the conventional\nrestriction to positive-frequency fields. Yet it provides a consistent quantum\nmechanical description of Klein-Gordon fields with a genuine probabilistic\ninterpretation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jul 2003 13:14:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Dec 2003 11:17:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2006 08:24:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Unitary errors are systematic, and result in a\ndensity matrix that differs from the desired one by a unitary operation.\nDecoherent errors correspond to general completely positive superoperators, and\ncan only be corrected using methods such as quantum error correction.\nIncoherent errors can also be described, on average, by completely positive\nsuperoperators, but can nevertheless be corrected by the application of a\nlocally unitary operation that ``refocuses'' them. They are due to reproducible\nspatial or temporal variations in the system's Hamiltonian, so that information\non the variations is encoded in the system's spatiotemporal state and can be\nused to correct them. In this paper liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance\n(NMR) is used to demonstrate that such refocusing effects can be built directly\ninto the control fields, where the incoherence arises from spatial\ninhomogeneities in the quantizing static magnetic field as well as the\nradio-frequency control fields themselves. Using perturbation theory, it is\nfurther shown that the eigenvalue spectrum of the completely positive\nsuperoperator exhibits a characteristic spread that contains information on the\nHamiltonians' underlying distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jul 2003 15:49:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
