Motivated by a phenomenologically\nsuccessful texturewith four texture zeros in the standard model, we propose a\npredictive ansatz for the Yukawa coupling matrices with the same texture in the\ngeneral 2HDM. Compared with the six texture-zero based ansatz proposed by Cheng\nand Sher, it is in a better agreement with the data of quark mixings and CP\nviolation. The four texture-zero based ansatz predicts a different hierarchy in\nthe Yukawa coupling matrix elements. As a consequence, in the lepton sector,\nthe related Yukawa couplings are less constrained by the experimental upper\nbound of $\\mu\\to e\\gamma$, which allows significantly larger predictions for\nother processes. The contributions from neutral scalar interactions to the\nlepton number violation decay modes $\\ell\\to \\ell_{1}\\ell_{2}\\ell_{3}$ are\ncalculated in both ansatz.

At present\na large database of digitized mammographic images (more than 6000) was\ncollected and a software based on neural network algorithms for the search of\nsuspicious breast lesions was developed. Two tools are available: a\nmicrocalcification clusters hunter, based on supervised and unsupervised\nfeedforward neural network, and a massive lesions searcher, based on a hibrid\napproach. Both the algorithms analyzed preprocessed digitized images by high\nfrequency filters. Clinical tests were performed to evaluate sensitivity and\nspecificity of the system, considering the system as alone and as secon reader.\nResults show that the system is ready to be implemented by medical industry.\nThe CALMA project, just ended, has its natural development in the GPCALMA (Grid\nPlatform for CALMA) project, where distributed users join common resources\n(images, tools, statistical analysis).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Jul 2003 13:40:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
