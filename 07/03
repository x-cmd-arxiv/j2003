We find that a critical experimental exposure $\\Sigma_c$\nexists, such that experiments with exposure larger than $\\Sigma_c$ can detect\nat least one event from each source at energies above $10^{20}$ eV. This\nrepresents a unique opportunity to directly count and identify the sources of\nUHECRs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jul 2003 10:34:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

In this model, we consider the\nnearest-point-on-curve and farthest-point-on-curve problems: given a curve C\nand a point p, find a point on C nearest to p or farthest from p. In the\ngeneral black-box model, no algorithm can solve these problems. Assuming a\nknown bound on the speed of the curve (a Lipschitz condition), the answer can\nbe estimated up to an additive error of epsilon using O(1/epsilon) samples, and\nthis bound is tight in the worst case. However, many instances can be solved\nwith substantially fewer samples, and we give algorithms that adapt to the\ninherent difficulty of the particular instance, up to a logarithmic factor.\nMore precisely, if OPT(C,p,epsilon) is the minimum number of samples of C that\nevery correct algorithm must perform to achieve tolerance epsilon, then our\nalgorithm performs O(OPT(C,p,epsilon) log (epsilon^(-1)/OPT(C,p,epsilon)))\nsamples. Furthermore, any algorithm requires Omega(k log (epsilon^(-1)/k))\nsamples for some instance C' with OPT(C',p,epsilon) = k; except that, for the\nnearest-point-on-curve problem when the distance between C and p is less than\nepsilon, OPT is 1 but the upper and lower bounds on the number of samples are\nboth Theta(1/epsilon). When bounds on relative error are desired, we give\nalgorithms that perform O(OPT log (2+(1+epsilon^(-1)) m^(-1)/OPT)) samples\n(where m is the exact minimum or maximum distance from p to C) and prove that\nOmega(OPT log (1/epsilon)) samples are necessary on some problem instances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jul 2003 01:14:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Dec 2003 17:58:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2004 15:48:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The storage ring DELSY is an electron storage ring with\nthe beam energy 1.2 GeV and 4 straight sections to accommodate accelerator\nequipment and insertion devices. One of the straight sections is intended for a\n10 T superconducting wiggler (wavelength shifter) and one for the undulator\nwith 150 periods and a magnetic field of 0.75 T. The wiggler will influence\nmany aspects of beam dynamics: linear motion, dynamic aperture, emittance,\ndamping times etc. The problem is rather serious for the DELSY machine because\nthe energy of the electron beam is small while the wiggler's magnetic field is\nstrong.

Pure states are vectors of a suitable linear\nspace over the quaternions. Other aspects of the theory are the same as in\nquantum computing: superposition and linearity of the state space, unitarity of\nthe transformations, and projective measurements. However, one notable\nexception is the fact that quaternionic circuits do not have a uniquely defined\nbehaviour, unless a total ordering of evaluation of the gates is defined. Given\nsuch an ordering a unique unitary operator can be associated with the\nquaternionic circuit and a proper semantics of computation can be associated\nwith it.\n  The main result of this paper consists in showing that this model is no more\npowerful than quantum computing, as long as such an ordering of gates can be\ndefined. More concretely we show, that for all quaternionic computation using n\nquaterbits, the behaviour of the circuit for each possible gate ordering can be\nsimulated with n+1 qubits, and this with little or no overhead in circuit size.\nThe proof of this result is inspired of a new simplified and improved proof of\nthe equivalence of a similar model based on real amplitudes to quantum\ncomputing, which states that any quantum computation using n qubits can be\nsimulated with n+1 rebits, and in this with no circuit size overhead.\n  Beyond this potential computational equivalence, however, we propose this\nmodel as a simpler framework in which to discuss the possibility of a\nquaternionic quantum mechanics or information theory. In particular, it already\nallows us to illustrate that the introduction of quaternions might violate some\nof the ``natural'' properties that we have come to expect from physical models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jul 2003 19:14:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2004 21:22:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
