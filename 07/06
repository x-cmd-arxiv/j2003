Interactions with these disks cause\nthem to migrate and thus affect their final orbital periods. We suggest that\nthe connection between planets and disks may be deeper and involve a symbiotic\nevolution. By contributing to the outward transport of angular momentum,\nplanets promote disk accretion. Here we demonstrate that planets sufficiently\nmassive to open gaps could be the primary agents driving disk accretion. Those\nhaving masses below the gap opening threshold drift inward more rapidly than\nthe disk material and can only play a minor role in its accretion. Eccentricity\ngrowth during gap formation may involve an even more intimate symbiosis. Given\na small initial eccentricity, just a fraction of a percent, the orbital\neccentricity of a massive planet may grow rapidly once a mass in excess of the\nplanet's mass has been repelled to form a gap around the planet's orbit. Then,\nas the planet's radial excursions approach the gap's width, subsequent\neccentricity growth slows so that the planet's orbit continues to be confined\nwithin the gap.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Jul 2003 19:24:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

In the calculations, the time\nevolution of gas temperature in theejecta, which strongly affects the number\ndensity and size of newly formed grains, is calculated by solving the radiative\ntransfer equation taking account of the energy deposition of radio active\nelements. Two extreme cases are considered for the mixing of elements in the\nejecta; unmixed and uniformly mixed cases within the He--core.\n  The results of calculations are summarized as the followings; in the unmixed\nejecta, a variety of grain species condense, reflecting the difference of the\nelemental composition at the formation site in the ejecta, otherwise only oxide\ngrains condense in the uniformly mixed ejecta. The average size of newly formed\ngrains spans the range of three orders of magnitude, depending on the grain\nspecies and the formation condition, and the maximum radius is limited to less\nthan 1 $\\mu$m, which does not depend on the progenitor mass. The size\ndistribution function summed up over all grain species is approximated by a\npower--law formula whose index is -3.5 for the larger radius and -2.5 for the\nsmaller one; the radius at the crossover point ranges from 0.004 to 0.1 $\\mu$m,\ndepending on the model of supernovae.

Superfield theories on a noncommutative superspace can be\nformulated in two folds, through the star product formalism and in terms of the\nsupermatrices. We elaborate the duality between them by constructing the\nisomorphism explicitly and relating the superspace integrations of the star\nproduct Lagrangian or the superpotential to the traces of the supermatrices. We\nshow there exists an interesting fine tuned commutative limit where the duality\ncan be still maintained. Namely on the commutative superspace too, there exists\na supermatrix model description for the superfield theory. We interpret the\nresult in the context of the wave particle duality. The dual particles for the\nsuperfields in even and odd spacetime dimensions are D-instantons and D0-branes\nrespectively to be consistent with the T-duality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Jul 2003 09:29:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Aug 2003 08:49:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2004 18:32:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}

Viewing them as first-order time-dependent operator equations for the\nelements of the density matrix, a unitary integration procedure can be adapted\nto solve for these matrix elements. A simple model for decoherence preserves\nthe hermiticity of the density matrix. A single, classical Riccati equation is\nthe only one requiring numerical handling to obtain a full solution of the\nquantum evolution. The procedure is general, valid for any number of levels,\nbut is illustrated here for a three-level system with two driving fields. For\nvarious choices of the initial state, we study the evolution of the system as a\nfunction of the amplitudes, relative frequencies and phases of the driven\nfields, and of the strength of the decoherence. The monotonic growth of the\nentropy is followed as the system evolves from a pure to a mixed state. An\nexample is provided by the $n=3$ states of the hydrogen atom in a\ntime-dependent electric field, such degenerate manifolds affording an\nanalytical solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Jul 2003 17:19:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
