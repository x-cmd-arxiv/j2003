The\nsplitting between the chiral doublers follows from a mixing between the light\nconstituent quark mass and the velocity of the heavy quark, and vanishes for a\nzero constituent quark mass. The general strictures of spontaneous chiral\nsymmetry breaking constrain the axial charges in the chiral multiplet, and\nyield a mass splitting between the chiral doublers of about 345 MeV when the\npion coupling to the doublers is half its coupling to a free quark. The chiral\ncorrections are small. This phenomenon is generic and extends to all\nheavy-light hadrons. We predict the mass splitting for the chiral doublers of\nthe excited mesons (D1,D2).
