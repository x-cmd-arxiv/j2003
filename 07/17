Because of the\nanisotropy of the turbulent magnetic field, the regular magnetic fields\nstrength, obtained from synchrotron emission using standard formulae, can be\noverestimated. A positive correlation between cosmic-ray number density and\nmagnetic field leads to an overestimate of the strengths of the regular and\ntotal fields.

Based on the good agreement\nbetween the two theoretical frameworks, we conclude that the energy dependence\nof the dynamical polarizabilities is dominated by chiral dynamics, except in\nthose multipole channels where the first nucleon resonance Delta(1232) can be\nexcited. Both the dispersion theory framework and a chiral effective field\ntheory with explicit Delta(1232) degrees of freedom lead to a very good\ndescription of the available low energy proton Compton data. We discuss the\nsensitivity of the proton Compton cross section to dynamical polarizabilities\nof different multipole content and present a fit of the static electric and\nmagnetic dipole polarizabilities from low-energy Compton data up to omega=170\nMeV, finding alpha_E=(11.04+-1.36)*10^(-4) fm^3, beta_M =(2.76-+1.36)*10^(-4)\nfm^3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jul 2003 10:07:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Phys. 34, 1953, ibid (2002) 35, 469]. In three\ncases (sodium, magnesium and mercury), a detailed consideration proves that\nthis representation is accurate in a fairly wide energy range. Moreover, the\nrelated momentum transfer cross sections are tailor-made for studying \"elastic\"\nelectron transport in terms of the two-term solution of the Boltzmann equation:\nNot only are the resulting swarm transport coefficients adjustable to the\nexperimental values, but above all they are calculable very easily because the\nunnormalized energy distribution is obtainable analytically. The ample saving\nin computational effort is exploited in order to test the Wannier-Robson\n\"momentum-transfer approximation\"; it is found that, in these cases of\nresonance-dominated cross sections, the latter method can be so accurate that\nit can be used to recover the momentum transfer cross section from experimental\ndata algebraically.
