We consider a\nnearby medium loaded with $e^{\\pm}$ pairs (Beloborodov 2002).

On the other hand, the standard accretion disk around the Kerr black\nhole might explain the observed high disk temperature, as the inner radius of\nthe Kerr disk gets smaller and the disk temperature can be consequently higher.\nHowever, we point out that the observable Kerr disk spectra becomes\nsignificantly harder than Schwarzschild disk spectra only when the disk is\nhighly inclined. This is because the emission from the innermost part of the\naccretion disk is Doppler-boosted for an edge-on Kerr disk, while hardly seen\nfor a face-on disk.

For ULXs, on the other hand,\nthe standard Kerr disk model seems implausible, since it is highly unlikely\nthat their accretion disks are preferentially inclined, and, if edge-on Kerr\ndisk model is applied, the black hole mass becomes unreasonably large (> 300\nM_solar). Instead, the slim disk (advection dominated optically thick disk)\nmodel is likely to explain the observed super-Eddington luminosities, hard\nenergy spectra, and spectral variations of ULXs.

Using low order polynomials to approximate the\nradial distortion might not be precise enough. On the other hand, higher order\npolynomials suffer from the inverse problem.

The fishnet spin configuration\nrequires two mean fields \\phi,\\phi' where the fishnet diagram is the case\n\\phi=1,\\phi'=0. For general values of these fields, the system is then\napproximated as a light-cone quantized string with a field dependent effective\nstring tension T_{eff}(\\phi,\\phi').

In the most simple-minded implementation of the\nmean field method, we find that the tension vanishes for weak and moderate\ncoupling, but for very large coupling stays non-zero.

The model is based on known chemical labels, axonal\nrepulsion/competition, stochasticity and uses Markov chain description. Our\nmodel suggests that the map in heterozygotes is single-valued in the temporal\nregion of retina due to reduced gradient of ephrin in the corresponding region\nof SC. The remaining map is double-valued since the gradient of ephrin is high\nthere. We predict therefore that if gradient of ephrin is reduced by a genetic\nmanipulation, the single-valued region of the map should occupy a larger\nportion of temporal retina, i.e. the point of transition between single- and\ndoulble-valued maps should move to a more nasal position in Isl2-EphA3\nheterozygotes. We also discuss the importance of inhomogeneous EphA gradient\nand mapping in Isl2/EphB knock-ins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jul 2003 15:56:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
