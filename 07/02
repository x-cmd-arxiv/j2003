We present the kinematic and clustering properties of this survey. We\ncompare low- and high-ionization transition widths and find that the sub-DLAs\nproperties roughly span the parameter space of DLAs. We analyse the chemical\ncontent of this sample in conjunction with abundances from 72 DLAs taken from\nthe literature. We compute the HI column density-weighted mean abundance which\nis believed to be an indicator of the Universe's metallicity. Although the\nnumber statistics is limited, the results suggest a slightly stronger evolution\nin the sub-DLA range. The evolution we probe is not due to their lower dust\ncontent. Therefore these systems might be associated with a different class of\nobjects which better trace the overall chemical evolution of the Universe.\nFinally, we present abundance ratios of [Si/Fe], [O/Fe], [C/Fe] and [Al/Fe],\nbut it is difficult to decipher whether the observed values are the effect of\nnucleosynthesis or are due to differential dust depletion. The metallicities\nare compared with two different sets of models of galaxy evolution in order to\nprovide constraints on the morphology of the absorbers [abridged].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jul 2003 15:44:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We do not limit our attention to gravitational modes, thus\nfilling some gaps in the existing literature. The frequency of gravitational\nmodes with l=m=2 tends to \\omega_R=2 \\Omega, \\Omega being the angular velocity\nof the black hole horizon. If Hod's conjecture is valid, this asymptotic\nbehaviour is related to reversible black hole transformations. Other highly\ndamped modes with m>0 that we computed do not show a similar behaviour. The\nreal part of modes with l=2 and m<0 seems to asymptotically approach a constant\nvalue \\omega_R\\simeq -m\\varpi, \\varpi\\simeq 0.12 being (almost) independent of\na. For any perturbing field, trajectories in the complex plane of QNM's with\nm=0 show a spiralling behaviour, similar to the one observed for\nReissner-Nordstrom (RN) black holes. Finally, for any perturbing field, the\nasymptotic separation in the imaginary part of consecutive modes with m>0 is\ngiven by 2\\pi T_H (T_H being the black hole temperature). We conjecture that\nfor all values of l and m>0 there is an infinity of modes tending to the\ncritical frequency for superradiance (\\omega_R=m) in the extremal limit.\nFinally, we study in some detail modes branching off the so--called\n``algebraically special frequency'' of Schwarzschild black holes. For the first\ntime we find numerically that QNM multiplets emerge from the algebraically\nspecial Schwarzschild modes, confirming a recent speculation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jul 2003 18:46:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Oct 2003 15:10:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The algebra is defined as follows. Let\nK denote a field, and let $\\beta, \\gamma, \\gamma^*, \\varrho, \\varrho^*$ denote\na sequence of scalars taken from K. The corresponding Tridiagonal algebra $T$\nis the associative K-algebra with 1 generated by two symbols $A$, $A^*$ subject\nto the relations (i) \\lbrack A,A^2A^*-\\beta AA^*A + A^*A^2 -\\gamma (AA^*+A^*A)-\n\\varrho A^*\\rbrack = 0,\n  (ii) \\lbrack A^*,A^{*2}A-\\beta A^*AA^* + AA^{*2} -\\gamma^* (A^*A+AA^*)-\n\\varrho^* A\\rbrack = 0, where $\\lbrack r,s\\rbrack $ means $rs-sr$.

For $\\beta = 2$, $\\gamma = \\gamma^*=0$, $\\varrho=b^2$,\n$\\varrho^*=b^{*2}$, the Tridiagonal relations are the Dolan-Grady relations. In\nthe first part of this paper, we survey what is known about irreducible finite\ndimensional $T$-modules.

The\nnucleon-deuteron break-up amplitude is evaluated in leading order in the NN\nT-matrix, which is also generated directly in three dimensions avoiding a\nsummation of partial wave contributions. A comparison of semi-exclusive\nobservables in the $d(p,n)pp$ reaction calculated in this scheme with those\ngenerated by a traditional partial wave expansion shows perfect agreement at\nlower energies. At about 200 MeV nucleon laboratory energies deviations in the\npeak of the cross section appear, which may indicate that special care is\nrequired in a partial wave approach for energies at and higher than 200 MeV.\nThe role of higher order rescattering processes beyond the leading order in the\nNN T-matrix is investigated with the result, that at 200 MeV rescattering still\nprovides important contributions to the cross section and certain spin\nobservables. The influence of a relativistic treatment of the kinematics is\ninvestigated. It is found that relativistic effects become important at\nprojectile energies higher than 200 MeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jul 2003 14:14:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

After\nalternating field or thermal cleaning the directions of remanence are generally\nwell clustered within flow units. In contrast, the thermal instability of the\nsamples did not allow to obtain reliable paleointensity determinations. The\ngeomagnetic transition is incompletely recorded due to a gap in volcanic\nactivity attested both by eolian deposits and a large angular distance between\nthe field directions of the flows underlying or overlying these deposits. The\ntransition path is noticeably different from that reported in the pioneer work\nof van Zijl et al. (1962). The most transitional Virtual Geomagnetic Poles are\nobserved after the volcanic hiatus. Once continents are replaced in their\nrelative position 180 Ma ago, the post-hiatus VGP cluster over Russia. However,\ntwo successive rebounds from that cluster are found, with VGP reaching\nrepeatedly Eastern Asia coast. Thus, the VGP path is not narrowly constrained\nin paleolongitude.
