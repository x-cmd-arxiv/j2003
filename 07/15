After reviewing our work on the interplay among Tc,\nhole content, and pressure in the bilayered and multilayered cuprate\nsuperconductors, we will discuss how the proximity to an electronic topological\ntransition (ETT) may give a microscopic justification of the ``intrinsic''\npressure dependence of Tc in the cuprates. As a function of the proximity to an\nETT, we recover a nonmonotonic behaviour of the superconducting gap at T=0,\nregardless of the pairing symmetry of the order parameter. This is in agreement\nwith the trend observed for Tc as a function of pressure and other material\nspecific quantities in several high-Tc cuprates. In the case of epitaxially\nstrained cuprate thin films, we argue that an ETT can be driven by a\nstrain-induced modification of the in-plane band structure, at constant hole\ncontent, at variance with a doping-induced ETT, as is usually assumed. We also\nfind that an increase of the in-plane anisotropy enhances the effect of\nfluctuations above Tc on the normal-state transport properties, which is a\nfingerprint of quantum criticality at T=0.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jul 2003 10:00:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

To evaluate\nthis propagator in the semi-classical region, and for times less than the\nEhrenfest time, we express its effect on an initial Gaussian wave packet in\nterms of quantities analogous to those used to describe the exponential\nseparation of trajectories in the classical version of this system. This result\nrelates the spread of the wave packet to the rate of separation of classical\ntrajectories, characterized by positive Lyapunov exponents. We consider\napplications of these results, first to illustrate the behavior of the\nwave-packet auto-correlation functions for wave packets on periodic orbits. The\nauto-correlation function can be related to the fidelity, or Loschmidt echo,\nfor the special case that the perturbation is a small change in the mass of the\nparticle. An exact expression for the fidelity, appropriate for this\nperturbation, leads to an analytical result valid over very long time\nintervals, inversely proportional to the size of the mass perturbation. For\nsuch perturbations, we then calculate the long-time echo for semi-classical\nwave packets on periodic orbits. This paper also corrects an earlier\ncalculation for a quantum echo, included in a previous version of this paper.\nWe explain the reasons for this correction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jul 2003 14:39:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2004 19:02:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2006 19:24:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
