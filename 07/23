The CO (J=6-5) and (J=7-6) lines were detected using the IRAM\nPlateau de Bure interferometer, showing a width of ~280 km/s. An upper flux\nlimit for the CO (J=1-0) line was obtained from observations with the\nEffelsberg 100-meter telescope. Assuming no gravitational magnification, we\nestimate a molecular gas mass of ~2x10^10 M_sun. Using the CO (3-2)\nobservations by Walter et al. (2003), a comparison of the line flux ratios with\npredictions from a large velocity gradient model suggests that the gas is\nlikely of high excitation, at densities ~10^5 cm^-3 and a temperature ~100 K.\nSince in this case the CO lines appear to have moderate optical depths, the gas\nmust be extended over a few kpc. The gas mass detected in J1148+5251 can fuel\nstar formation at the rate implied by the far-infrared luminosity for less than\n10 million years, a time comparable to the dynamical time of the region. The\ngas must therefore be replenished quickly, and metal and dust enrichment must\noccur fast. The strong dust emission and massive, dense gas reservoir at z~6.4\nprovide further evidence that vigorous star formation is co-eval with the rapid\ngrowth of massive black holes at these early epochs of the Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jul 2003 15:43:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The\ncorrelation and distribution functions as well as the variance of number of\nsymbols in the words of arbitrary length L are obtained analytically and\nnumerically. A self-similarity of the studied stochastic process is revealed\nand the similarity group transformation of the chain parameters is presented.\nThe diffusion Fokker-Planck equation governing the distribution function of the\nL-words is explored. If the persistent correlations are not extremely strong,\nthe distribution function is shown to be the Gaussian with the variance being\nnonlinearly dependent on L.
