We demonstrate the phenomenon of I-front trapping inside\nminihalos, in which the weak, R-type fronts which traveled supersonically\nacross the IGM decelerated when they encountered the dense, neutral gas inside\nminihalos, becoming D-type I-fronts, preceded by shock waves. For a minihalo\nwith virial temperature T_vir < 10^4 K, the I-front gradually burned its way\nthrough the minihalo which trapped it, removing all of its baryonic gas by\ncausing a supersonic, evaporative wind to blow backwards into the IGM, away\nfrom the exposed layers of minihalo gas just behind the advancing I-front. Such\nhitherto neglected feedback effects were widespread during reionization. N-body\nsimulations and analytical estimates of halo formation suggest that sub-kpc\nminihalos such as these, with T_vir < 10^4 K, were so common as to cover the\nsky around larger-mass source halos and possibly dominate the absorption of\nionizing photons. This means that previous estimates of the number of ionizing\nphotons per H atom required to complete reionization which neglected this\neffect may be too low. Regardless of their effect on the progress of\nreionization, however, the minihalos were so abundant that random lines of\nsight thru the high-z universe should encounter many of them, which suggests\nthat it may be possible to observe the processes described here in the\nabsorption spectra of distant sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Jul 2003 02:58:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-06"}

A relation between the nuclear\nmatter density and the chemical potential with the action of QCD being taken\ninto account is obtained. A maximal nuclear matter density for the existence of\nthe bag with three quarks confined within is given. The calculated results\nindicate that, before the maximal density is reached, the bag constant and the\ntotal energy of a nucleon decrease, and the radius of a nucleon increases\nslowly, with the increasing of the nuclear matter density. As the maximal\nnuclear matter density is reached, the mass of the nucleon vanishes and the\nradius becomes infinite suddenly. It manifests that a phase transition from\nnucleons to quarks takes place.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Jul 2003 13:28:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
