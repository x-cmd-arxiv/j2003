We investigate the nature of the\ndisc response and conditions for gap formation. This issue is an important one\nfor determining the type and nature of the migration of the protoplanet, with\nthe presence of a deep gap being believed to enable slower migration. For both\ntypes of simulation we find a common pattern of behaviour for which the main\nparameter determining the nature of the response is $M_p R^3/(M_* H^3)$, with\n$M_p$, $M_*$, $R$, and $H$ being the protoplanet mass, the central mass, the\norbital radius and the disc semi-thickness respectively. We find that as this\nparameter is increased towards 0.1, the presence of the protoplanet is first\nindicated by the appearance of the well known trailing wake which, although it\nmay appear erratic on account of the turbulence, appears to be well defined.\nOnce the above parameter exceeds a number around unity a gap starts to develop\ninside which the magnetic energy density tends to be concentrated in the high\ndensity wakes. This gap formation condition can be understood from simple\ndimensional considerations of the conditions for nonlinearity, and the balance\nof angular momentum transport due to Maxwell and Reynolds' stresses with that\ndue to tidal torques. An important result is that the basic flow morphology in\nthe vicinity of the protoplanet is very similar in both the local and global\nsimulations.

Spectroscopy of the bursts, as well as the presence of continuous burst\noscillations, suggests that all but one of the bursts are sub-Eddington. The\nremaining burst has the largest peak bolometric flux of 2.64 x E^-8\nerg/sec/cm^2, as well as a gap in the burst oscillations, similar to that seen\nin Eddington limited bursts from other sources. Assuming this burst was\nEddington limited we obtain a source distance of about 8 kpc. All the bursts\nshow coherent oscillations at the 314.4 Hz spin frequency. The burst\noscillations are strongly frequency and phase locked to the persistent\npulsations. Only two bursts show evidence for frequency drift in the first few\nseconds following burst onset. In both cases the initial drift corresponds to a\nspin down of a few tenths of a Hz. The large oscillation amplitude during the\nbursts confirms that the burst flux is modulated at the spin frequency. We\ndetect, for the first time, a significant first harmonic component in burst\noscillations. The ratio of countrate in the first harmonic to that in the\nfundamental can be > 0.25 and is, on average, less than that of the persistent\npulsations. If the pulsations result from a single bright region on the\nsurface, the harmonic strength suggests the burst emission is beamed, perhaps\ndue to a stronger magnetic field than in non-pulsing LMXBs. Alternatively, the\nharmonic content could result from a geometry with two bright regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Aug 2003 19:32:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

In the embedded cases it oscillated between negative and positive\nvalues, and migration occurs as a random walk, unlike the usual type I\nmigration. Running time averages for embedded planets over 20-25 orbital\nperiods show that large fluctuations occur on longer time scales, preventing\nconvergence of the average torque to well defined values, or even to a well\ndefined sign. Fluctuations become relatively smaller for larger masses, giving\nbetter convergence, due to the planet's perturbation of the disc becoming\nlarger than the turbulence in its vicinity. Eventually gap formation occurs,\nwith a transition to type II migration. The existence of significant\nfluctuations occurring in turbulent discs on long time scales is important for\nlower mass embedded protoplanets. If significant fluctuations occur on the\nlongest disc evolutionary time scales, convergence of torque running averages\nfor practical purposes will not occur, and the migration behaviour of low mass\nprotoplanets considered as an ensemble would be very different from predictions\nof type I theory for laminar discs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Aug 2003 20:41:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The amount of dust (measured by the luminosity fraction\n\\fdust=L_\\mathrm{IR}/L_{\\star}) seen around main-sequence stars of different\nages shows several interesting trends. To discuss these results in the context\nof a physical model, we develop in this paper an analytical model for the dust\nproduction in Vega-type systems. Previously it has been claimed that a powerlaw\nslope of about -2 in the diagram plotting amount of dust versus time could be\nexplained by a simple collisional cascade. We show that such a cascade in fact\nresults in a powerlaw \\fdust\\propto t^{-1} if the dust removal processes are\ndominated by collisions. A powerlaw \\fdust\\propto t^{-2} only results when the\ndust removal processes become dominated by Pointing-Robertson drag. This may be\nthe case in the Kuiper Belt of our own solar system, but it is certainly not\nthe case in any of the observed disks. A steeper slope can, however, be created\nby including continuous stirring into the models. We show that the existence of\nboth young and old Vega-like systems with large amounts of dust (\\fdust\\simeq\n10^{-3}) can be explained qualitatively by Kuiper-Belt-like structures with\n\\emph{delayed stirring}. Finally, the absence of young stars with intermediate\namounts of dust may be due to the fact that stirring due to planet formation\nmay not be active in young low-mass disks.
