The reason\nto cause time reversal symmetry violation is that certain filial or partial\ntransitive processes of bounding state atoms are forbidden or can not be\nachieved actually due to the law of energy conservation, the asymmetric actions\nof effective transition operators before and after time reversal, as well as\nthe special states of atoms themselves. These restrictions would cause the\nsymmetry violation of time reversal of other filial or partial transition\nprocesses which can be actualized really. The symmetry violation is also\nrelative to the initial state asymmetries of bounding atoms before and after\ntime reversal. For the electromagnetic interaction between non-bounding state\natoms and radiation field, there is no this kind of symmetry violation of time\nreversal. In this way, the current formula of light stimulated radiation and\nabsorption parameters with time reversal symmetry should be revised. The\ninfluence of time reversal symmetry violation on the foundational theory of\nlaser is also discussed and the phenomena of non-population inversion and\nnon-radiation transition can also be explained well. In this way, a more\nreliable foundation can be established for the theories of laser and nonlinear\noptics in which non-equilibrium processes are involved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Aug 2003 02:26:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2004 07:04:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 2005 07:54:45 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 10 Apr 2008 08:59:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-04-10"}
