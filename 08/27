This allows one to compare the ranges of two such frames, which\nis useful for determining similarity and also for multiplexing schemes. Our\nresults then partially extend to Bessel sequences arising from the action of\nthe group. We apply the results to sampling on bandlimited functions and to\nwavelet and Weyl-Heisenberg frames. This yields a sufficient condition for two\nsampling transforms to have orthogonal ranges, and two analysis operators for\nwavelet and Weyl-Heisenberg frames to have orthogonal ranges. The sufficient\ncondition is easy to compute in terms of the periodization of the Fourier\ntransform of the frame generators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Aug 2003 20:13:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
