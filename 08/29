The general characteristics\nof these newly-formed clusters (such as their masses, luminosities, and sizes)\nsuggest that at least a fraction may eventually evolve into equal, or perhaps\nslightly more massive, counterparts of the abundant old globular cluster\nsystems in the local Universe. Establishing whether or not such an evolutionary\nconnection exists requires our detailed knowledge of not only the physics\nunderlying the evolution of \"simple\" stellar populations, but also that of\ncluster disruption in the time-dependent gravitational potentials of\ninteracting galaxies.

In this paper we (re-)consider the Cepheid star population of\nNGC1866, to try to shed some light on this discrepancy. By combining various\nextensive photometric datasets in BVI and single-epoch 2MASS JHK photometry, PL\nrelationships for the cluster Cepheids are obtained. A comparison between the\nfield LMC and cluster PL relationships for the reddening free Wesenheit index\ngives a firm determination of the distance between the cluster and the LMC main\nbody (0.04 mag in distance modulus, the cluster being more distant) which,\ncoupled to a model for the geometry of the LMC disk, provides \\Delta (DM)\nranging between 0.0 and -0.11 mag. The simultaneous comparison of the PL\nrelationships in BVI for the cluster and LMC field gives an estimate of the\ncluster reddening, which results to be E(B-V) = 0.12 \\pm 0.02. This\ndetermination is higher than the canonical value of 0.06 mag used in all\nprevious studies, but we show that it is not in contradiction with a\nre-analysis of independent estimates.

Inoue et al. (2000, IHK)\nhave derived a formula for the conversion from IR luminosity to SFR by using\nthe following three quantities: the fraction of Lyman continuum luminosity\nabsorbed by gas (f), the fraction of UV luminosity absorbed by dust (epsilon),\nand the fraction of dust heating from old (>10^8 yr) stellar populations (eta).\nWe develop a method to estimate those three quantities based on the idea that\nthe various way of SFR estimates should return the same SFR. After applying our\nmethod to samples of galaxies, the following results are obtained. First, our\nmethod is applied to star-forming galaxies, finding that f~0.6, epsilon~0.5,\nand eta~0.4 as representative values. Next, we apply the method to a starburst\nsample, which shows larger extinction than the star-forming galaxy sample. With\nthe aid of f, epsilon, and eta, we estimate reliable SFRs. Moreover, the\nH-alpha luminosity, if the H-alpha extinction is corrected by using the Balmer\ndecrement, is suitable for a statistical analysis of SFR, because the same\ncorrection factor for the Lyman continuum extinction is applicable to both\nnormal and starburst galaxies over all the range of SFR. The metallicity\ndependence of f and epsilon is also tested: Only the latter proves to have a\ncorrelation with metallicity. As an extension of our result, we show that all\nUV, H-alpha, and IR comoving luminosity densities at z=0 give a consistent SFR\n(~ 3x10^{-2}h M_sun/Mpc^3).

Using\nsingle particle trajectories we define a jump by comparing for each particle\nits fluctuations with its changes in average position. We find two kinds of\njumps: \"reversible jumps,\" where a particle jumps back and forth between two or\nmore average positions, and \"irreversible jumps,\" where a particle does not\nreturn to any of its former average positions. For all investigated\ntemperatures both kinds of particles jump and both irreversible and reversible\njumps occur.

We further demonstrate that the easy\nmagnetization axis can be controlled by incident light through a bolometric\neffect, which induces a pronounced increase in the amplitude of the AHE. A\nmean-field-theory model for the carrier-mediated ferromagnetism reproduces the\ntendency for dramatic reorientations of the magnetization axis, but not the\nspecific sensitivity to small temperature variations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Aug 2003 21:55:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The pull-back of\nthe metric under each causal symmetry results in a new rank-2 future tensor,\nand we prove that there is always a set of null directions canonical to the\ncausal symmetry. As a result of this it makes sense to classify causal\nsymmetries according to the number of independent canonical null directions.\nThis classification is maintained at the infinitesimal level where we find the\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for a vector field to be a causal motion.\nThey involve the Lie derivatives of the metric tensor and of the canonical null\ndirections.

For scalar-field electrodynamics, such\na summation of leading logarithm contributions leads to upper bounds on the\nmagnitudes of both gauge and scalar-field coupling constants, and suggests the\npossibility of an additional phase of spontaneous symmetry breaking\ncharacterized by a scalar-field mass comparable to that of the theory's gauge\nboson. For radiatively-broken electroweak symmetry, the all-orders summation of\nleading logarithm terms involving the dominant three couplings (quartic\nscalar-field, t-quark Yukawa, and QCD) contributing to standard-model radiative\ncorrections leads to an RG-improved potential characterized by a 216 GeV Higgs\nboson mass. Upon incorporation of electroweak gauge couplants we find that the\npredicted Higgs mass increases to 218 GeV. The potential is also characterized\nby a quartic scalar-field coupling over five times larger than that anticipated\nfor an equivalent Higgs mass obtained via conventional spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking, leading to a concomitant enhancement of processes (such as $W^+ W^-\n\\to ZZ$) sensitive to this coupling. Moreover, if the QCD coupling constant is\ntaken to be sufficiently strong, the tree potential's local minimum at $\\phi =\n0$ is shown to be restored for the summation of leading logarithm corrections.\nThus if QCD exhibits a two-phase structure similar to that of $N = 1$\nsupersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, the weaker asymptotically-free phase of QCD\nmay be selected by the large logarithm behaviour of the RG-improved effective\npotential for radiatively broken electroweak symmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Aug 2003 16:29:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Dec 2003 18:26:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2004 16:01:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}

This note is the\ndevelopment of the previous one in the direction of channels with general\nconstraints. Introducing input constraints provides greater flexibility in the\ntreatment of the additivity conjecture. The Holevo capacity of arbitrarily\nconstrained channel is considered and the characteristic property of an optimal\nensemble for such channel is derived, generalizing the maximal distance\nproperty of Schumacher and Westmoreland (proposition 1). It is shown that the\nadditivity conjecture for two channels with single linear constraints is\nequivalent to the similar conjecture for two arbitrarily constrained channels\nand, hence, to an interesting subadditivity property of the $\\chi$-function for\nthe tensor product of these channels (theorem 1).

For this configuration, photons are scattered only due\nto the mechanical effects of the quantum interaction between light and atom. We\nstudy the spectrum of emission in the final stage of laser--cooling, when the\natomic center-of-mass dynamics is quantum mechanical and the size of the wave\npacket is much smaller than the laser wavelength (Lamb--Dicke limit). We use\nthe spectral decomposition of the Liouville operator of the master equation for\nthe atomic density matrix and apply second order perturbation theory. We find\nthat the spectrum of resonance fluorescence is composed by two narrow sidebands\n-- the Stokes and anti-Stokes components of the scattered light -- while all\nother signals are in general orders of magnitude smaller. For very low\ntemperatures, however, the Mollow--type inelastic component of the spectrum\nbecomes visible. This exhibits novel features which allow further insight into\nthe quantum dynamics of the system. We provide a physical model that interprets\nour results and discuss how one can recover temperature and cooling rate of the\natom from the spectrum. The behaviour of the considered system is compared with\nthe resonance fluorescence of a trapped atom whose internal transition consists\nof two-levels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Aug 2003 11:01:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
