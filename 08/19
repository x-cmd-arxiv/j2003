Specifically, we employ the aperture mass statistics\n$M_{ap}$ to describe the cosmic shear. We divide the foreground galaxy redshift\n$z_f<z_s$ into several bins, where $z_s$ is the redshift of the source\ngalaxies, and calculate the quantity $<M_{ap}N_g(z_f)>^2/< N_g^2(z_f)>$ for\neach redshift bin. Then the ratio of the summation of $<M_{ap}N_g(z_f)>^2/<\nN_g^2(z_f)>$ over the bins to $<M_{ap}^2>$ gives a measure of the\nnonlinear/stochastic bias. Here $N_g(z_f)$ is the projected surface number\ndensity fluctuation of foreground galaxies at redshift $z_f$, and $M_{ap}$ is\nthe aperture mass from the cosmic-shear analysis.

We investigate the\nrate of decay of uncollapsed states, analyze the preferential pathways of\ncondensation, and describe likelihood and lifespan of the different metastable\nstates. The simulation are performed with a bead-stiff spring model with\nexcluded volume interaction and exponentially decaying attractive potential.\nThe semiflexible chain collapse is studied as functions of the three relevant\nlength scales of the phenomenon, i.e., the total chain length $L$, the\npersistence length $L_p$ and the condensation length $L_0 = \\sqrt{k_B T\nL_p/u_0}$, where $u_0$ is a measure of the attractive potential per unit\nlength. Two dimensionless ratios, $L/L_p$ and $L_0/L_p$, suffice to describe\nthe decay rate of uncollapsed states, which appears to scale as $(L/L_p)^{1/3}\n(L_0/L_p)$.

The feedback control is a generalization of the\ntime-delay method of Pyragas, which was proposed by Lu, Yu and Harrison in the\nsetting of nonlinear optics. It involves both spatial shifts, by the wavelength\nof the targeted traveling wave, and a time delay that coincides with the\ntemporal period of the traveling wave. We derive a single necessary and\nsufficient stability criterion which determines whether a traveling wave is\nstable to all perturbation wavenumbers. This criterion has the benefit that it\ndetermines an optimal value for the time-delay feedback parameter. For various\ncoefficients in the CGLE we use this algebraic stability criterion to\nnumerically determine stable regions in the (K,rho) parameter plane, where rho\nis the feedback parameter associated with the spatial translation and K is the\nwavenumber of the traveling wave. We find that the combination of the two\nfeedbacks greatly enlarges the parameter regime where stabilization is\npossible, and that the stability regions take the form of stability tongues in\nthe (K,rho)--plane. We discuss possible resonance mechanisms that could account\nfor the spacing with K of the stability tongues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Aug 2003 22:02:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
