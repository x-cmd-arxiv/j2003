This includes a brief\nreview of the direct CP-violating component, a calculation of the indirect\nCP-violating contribution, which is now possible after the measurement of K_S\n-> pi0 e+ e-, and a re-analysis of the CP conserving part. The latter is shown\nto be negligible, based on experimental input from K_L -> pi0 gamma gamma, a\nmore general treatment of the form factor entering the dispersive contribution,\nand on a comparison with the CP violating rate, which can now be estimated\nreliably. We predict B(K_L -> pi0 e+ e-) = (3.2 +1.2 -0.8) 10^{-11} in the\nStandard Model, dominated by CP violation with a sizable contribution (~40%)\nfrom the direct effect, largely through interference with the indirect one.\nMethods to deal with the severe backgrounds for K_L -> pi0 e+ e- using\nDalitz-plot analysis and time-dependent K_L-K_S interference are also briefly\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Aug 2003 09:40:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Nov 2003 12:30:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-09"}

This gives a\nchance to reconstruct the mean field level scheme near the Fermi surface.\nMoreover, due to the connection with electric $+AFw-lambda+AFw-mu =$21 mode,\nthe scissors mode can be detected. In heavy (supported) oblate clusters, LEQM\nare in general rather involved.
