We propose to generalize the detailed balance equations at the\nlocal level during the loop construction by accounting for the matrix elements\nof the operators associated with open world-line segments. Using linear\nprogramming techniques to solve the generalized equations, we look for optimal\nconstruction schemes for directed loops. This also allows for an extension of\nthe directed loop scheme to general lattice models, such as high-spin or\nbosonic models. The resulting algorithms are bounce-free in larger regions of\nparameter space than the original directed loop algorithm. The generalized\ndirected loop method is applied to the magnetization process of spin chains in\norder to compare its efficiency to that of previous directed loop schemes. In\ncontrast to general expectations, we find that minimizing bounces alone does\nnot always lead to more efficient algorithms in terms of autocorrelations of\nphysical observables, because of the non-uniqueness of the bounce-free\nsolutions. We therefore propose different general strategies to further\nminimize autocorrelations, which can be used as supplementary requirements in\nany directed loop scheme.

It is\nfound that under the synchroresonance condition, the first-order perturbative\nEM power fluxes will contain a ''left circular wave'' and a ''right circular\nwave'' around the symmetrical axis of the Gaussian beam. However, the\nperturbative effects produced by the states of + polarization and \\times\npolarization of the GW have a different physical behavior. For the HFGW of\n$\\nu_{g}=3GHz$, $h=10^{-30}$ (which corresponds to the power flux density $~\n10^{-6} W m^{-2}$) to $\\nu_{g}=1.3THz$, $ h=10^{-28}$ (which corresponds to the\npower flux density $~10^{3} W m^{-2}$) expected by the HFGW generators\ndescribed at this conference, the corresponding perturbative photon fluxes\npassing through a surface region of $10^{-2} m^{2}$ would be expected to be\n$10^{3} s^{-1} - 10^{4} s^{-1}$.

These are special\nsequences in that their local averages track the function values closely, thus\nenabling simple convolutional reconstruction. In this paper, we are concerned\nwith the approximation of constant functions only, a basic case that presents\nsurprisingly complex behavior. An m'th order Sigma-Delta scheme with input x\ncan be translated into a dynamical system that produces a discrete-valued\nsequence (in particular, a 0-1 sequence) q as its output. When the schemes are\nstable, we show that the underlying piecewise affine maps possess invariant\nsets that tile the Euclidean space up to a finite multiplicity. When this\nmultiplicity is one (the single-tile case), the dynamics within the tile is\nisomorphic to that of a generalized skew translation on the m dimensional\ntorus. The value of x can be approximated using any consecutive M elements in q\nwith increasing accuracy in M. We show that the asymptotical behavior of\nreconstruction error depends on the regularity of the invariant sets, the order\nm, and some arithmetic properties of x.

The method estimates the fraction of locally\nsyncronized configurations, in a pair of signals with an arbitrary state of\nglobal syncronization. Application to a pair of interacting Rossler oscillators\nshows that our method is capable to quantify the number of dynamical\nconfigurations where a local prediction task is possible, also in absence of\nglobal synchronization features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Aug 2003 14:12:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
