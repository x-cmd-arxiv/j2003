Clumps arise because after a planetary system forms its\nplanets migrate due to angular momentum exchange with the remaining\nplanetesimals. Outward migration of the outermost planet traps planetesimals\noutside its orbit into its resonances and resonant forces cause azimuthal\nstructure in their distribution. The model is based on numerical simulations of\nplanets of different masses, Mpl, migrating at different rates, dapl/dt,\nthrough a dynamically cold (e<0.01) planetesimal disk initially at a semimajor\naxis a. Trapping probabilities and the resulting azimuthal structures are\npresented for a planet's 2:1, 5:3, 3:2, and 4:3 resonances. Seven possible\ndynamical structures are identified from migrations defined by mu=Mpl/Mstar and\ntheta=dapl/dt*sqrt(a/Mstar). Application of this model to the 850um image of\nVega's disk shows its two clumps of unequal brightness can be explained by the\nmigration of a Neptune-mass planet from 40 to 65AU over 56Myr; tight\nconstraints are set on possible ranges of these parameters. The clumps are\ncaused by planetesimals in the 3:2 and 2:1 resonances; the asymmetry arises\nbecause of the overabundance of planetesimals in the 2:1(u) over the 2:1(l)\nresonance. The similarity of this migration to that proposed for our own\nNeptune hints that Vega's planetary system may be much more akin to the solar\nsystem than previously thought. Predictions are made which would substantiate\nthis model, such as the orbital motion of the clumpy pattern, the location of\nthe planet, and the presence of lower level clumps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Aug 2003 16:41:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Working\nwith XMM data we examine the distribution and properties of the hot gas which\nmakes up the group halo. The inner halo shows some signs of structure, with\ncircular or elliptical beta models providing a poor fit to the surface\nbrightness profile. This may be evidence of large scale motion in the inner\nhalo, but we do not find evidence of sharp fronts or edges in the emission. The\ntemperature of the halo declines in the core, with deprojected spectral fits\nshowing a central temperature of ~1.3 keV compared to ~3 keV at 100 kpc. In the\ncentral ~30 kpc of the group multi-temperature spectral models are required to\nfit the data, but they indicate a lack of gas at low temperatures. Steady state\ncooling flow models provide poor fits to the inner regions of the group and the\nestimated cooling time of the gas is long except within the central dominant\ngalaxy, NGC 4073. Abundance profiles show a sharp increase in the core of the\ngroup, with mean abundance rising by a factor of two in the centre of NGC 4073.\nFitting individual elements shows the same trend, with high values of Fe, Si\nand S in the core. We estimate that ~50% of the Fe in the central 40 kpc was\ninjected by SNIa, in agreement with previous ASCA studies. Using our best\nfitting surface brightness and temperature models, we calculate the mass, gas\nfraction, entropy and mass-to-light ratio of the group. At 100 kpc (~0.1 virial\nradii) the total mass and gas entropy of the system (~2x10^13 Msol and ~300 keV\ncm^2) are quite comparable to those of other systems of similar temperature,\nbut the gas fraction is rather low (~1%).

We introduce an adiabatic fast passage-style\ncharge pumping technique which enables efficient and robust readout via charge\nshelving, avoiding problems due to finite SET measurement time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Aug 2003 06:27:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 2004 07:19:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The basic idea is to dress the\nplaquettes of the lattice to view them as elementary homotopies between nearby\npaths. Instead of using a unique $G$-valued field to discretize the connection\n1-form, $A$, we use an $\\AG$-valued field $U$ on the edges, which plays the\nrole of the 1-form $\\ad_A$, and a $G$-valued field $V$ on the plaquettes, which\ncorresponds to the Faraday tensor, $F$. The 1-connection, $U$, and the\n2-connection, $V$, are then supposed to have a 2-curvature which vanishes. This\nconstraint determines $V$ as a function of $U$ up to a phase in $Z(G)$, the\ncenter of $G$. The 3-curvature around a cube is then Abelian and is interpreted\nas the magnetic charge contained inside this cube. Promoting the plaquettes to\nelementary homotopies induces a chiral splitting of their usual Boltzmann\nweight, $w=v\\bar{v}$, defined with the Wilson action. We compute the Fourier\ntransform, $\\hat{v}$, of this chiral Boltzmann weight on $G=SU_3$ and we obtain\na finite sum of generalized hypergeometric functions.

A klystron amplifier has the useful property that the various\nelectronic processes take place in separate portions of the amplifier, rather\nthan overlapping as in FEL amplifier with an uniform undulator. The klystron\nconsists of two fundamental parts: succession of 2-3 cascades (modulator), and\nan output undulator (radiator) in which the modulated electron beam coherently\nradiates. Each cascade consists of uniform undulator and dispersion section.\nUnlike distributed optical klystrons, we have a high gain per cascade pass.\nThis has a few consequences. First, klystron gain does not depend on the bunch\ncompression in the injector linac, i.e. maximum gain per cascade pass at high\npeak beam current is the same as at low peak beam current, without compression.\nConventional, short-wavelength FEL amplifier and distributed optical klystron\nrequire electron beam peak current of a few kA. Second, there are no\nrequirements on the alignment of the cascade undulators and dispersion\nsections, because, in our (high gain) case, there is no need for radiation\nphase matching. There are applications, like XFELs, where the unique properties\nof high gain klystron FEL amplifier are very desirable. Such a scheme allows\none to decrease the total length of the magnetic system.

A transcendental equation determining the\ndistribution function of anyons is obtained in terms of the statistics\nparameter, whose limiting values 0 and 1 correspond to Bosons and Fermions\nrespectively. The distribution function is determined as a power series\ninvolving the Boltzmann factor and the statistics parameter and we also express\nthe distribution function as an infinite continued fraction.

The method is based on the effective action\nformalism which includes the standard effective potential. The basic notions of\nthe EPAC are presented for a one-dimensional double well system in comparison\nwith the centroid molecular dynamics (CMD) and the exact real time quantum\ncorrelation function. It is shown that both the EPAC and the CMD well reproduce\nthe exact short time behavior, while at longer time their results deviate from\nthe exact one. The CMD correlation function damps rapidly with time because of\nensemble dephasing. The EPAC correlation function, however, can reproduce the\nlong time oscillation inherent in the quantum double well systems. It is also\nshown that the EPAC correlation function can be improved toward the exact\ncorrelation function by means of the higher order derivative expansion of the\neffective action.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Aug 2003 04:53:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
