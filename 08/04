In\nsufficiently well-ionized disks, the predominant form of disk viscosity\noriginates from the Magneto-Rotational Instability (MRI) that drives\nhydromagnetic disk turbulence. In the region of sufficiently low ionization\nrate -- the so-called dead zone -- turbulence is damped and we show that lower\nmass planets will be formed. We considered three ionization sources (X-rays,\ncosmic rays, and radioactive elements) and determined the size of a dead zone\nfor the total ionization rate by using a radiative, hydrostatic equilibrium\ndisk model developed by Chiang et al. (2001). We studied a range of surface\nmass density (Sigma_{0}=10^3 - 10^5 g cm^{-2}) and X-ray energy (kT_{x}=1 - 10\nkeV). We also compared the ionization rate of such a disk by X-rays with cosmic\nrays and find that the latter dominate X-rays in ionizing protostellar disks\nunless the X-ray energy is very high (5 - 10 keV). Among our major conclusions\nare that for typical conditions, dead zones encompass a region extending out to\nseveral AU -- the region in which terrestrial planets are found in our solar\nsystem. Our results suggest that the division between low and high mass planets\nin exosolar planetary systems is a consequence of the presence of a dead zone\nin their natal protoplanetary disks. We also find that the extent of a dead\nzone is mainly dependent on the disk's surface mass density. Our results\nprovide further support for the idea that Jovian planets in exosolar systems\nmust have migrated substantially inwards from their points of origin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Aug 2003 19:31:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

A non-trivial question is whether the problems (i) or\n(ii) belong to NP? We show that the answer is positive for some special values\nof k and d. Also we prove that the problem (ii) can be reduced to its special\ncase, such that all operators H_a are factorized projectors and all h_a=0.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Aug 2003 14:53:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2004 13:11:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This requires that the encoding and the decoding\noperation can be performed faster than the typical decoherence time of the\nunderlying system. The computational model underlying the one-way quantum\ncomputer, which has been introduced by Hans Briegel and Robert Raussendorf,\nprovides a suitable concept for a fast implementation of quantum error\ncorrecting codes. It is shown explicitly in this article is how encoding and\ndecoding operations for stabilizer codes can be realized on a one-way quantum\ncomputer. This is based on the graph code representation for stabilizer codes,\non the one hand, and the relation between cluster states and graph codes, on\nthe other hand.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Aug 2003 15:46:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
