We further suggest that\nthe gas within the dust lane can comprise much of the low ionization component\n(i.e., the one contributing the O VII edge) of the observed warm absorber.\nMoreover, placing the warm absorbing material at such distances (hundreds of\npc) can account for the small outflow velocities of the low ionization\nabsorption lines as well as the constancy of the O VIII edge. Photoionization\nmodels of a dusty interstellar gas cloud (with a column appropriate for the\nreddening toward MCG-6-30-15) using a toy Seyfert 1 spectral energy\ndistribution show that it is possible to obtain a significant O VII edge\n(\\tau~0.2) if the material is ~150 pc from the ionizing source.
