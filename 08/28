In particular, our data nicely fill in the flux gap in\nthe hard band between the Chandra Deep Field data and the previous ASCA data.\nWe check whether there is any systematic difference in the source density\nbetween cluster and non-cluster fields and also search for field-to-field\nvariations, both of which have been previously reported. We found no\nsignificant field-to-field cosmic variation in either test within the\nstatistics (~1 sigma) across the flux levels included in our sample. In the\nX-ray color-color plot, most sources fall in the location characterized by\nphoton index = 1.5-2 and NH = a few x 10^20 cm^2, suggesting that they are\ntypical broad-line AGNs. There also exist a considerable number of sources with\npeculiar X-ray colors (e.g., highly absorbed, very hard, very soft). We confirm\na trend that on average the X-ray color hardens as the count rate decreases.\nSince the hardening is confined to the softest energy band (0.3-0.9 keV), we\nconclude it is most likely due to absorption. We cross-correlate the X-ray\nsources with other catalogs and describe their properties in terms of optical\ncolor, X-ray-to-optical luminosity ratio and X-ray colors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Aug 2003 22:59:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-27"}

The model contains\nseveral microscopic, i.e. bare parameters determining the thermodynamic state\nof the system. General arguments are given to show that these parameters must\nbe independent not only of the lattice properties but also of the thermodynamic\nstate, and that the voids representing free volume must be carefully treated,\nif thermodynamics has to be properly obeyed. These facts have not always been\nappreciated in the literature. We focus on mixing functions, some of which have\nnot been properly calculated in the literature. In general, mixing is\nnon-isometric (non-zero volume of mixing) and the entropy of mixing is\nnon-ideal. We have recently developed a lattice theory for the general model,\nwhich goes beyond the random mixing approximation (RMA) limit and is\nthermodynamically consistent in the entire parameter space. The theory contains\nterms that do not have a continuum analog except in the RMA limit or for\npoint-like particles. Both the free volume and the total volume determine the\nthermodynamics of the system. The RMA limit of our theory gives rise to a new\ntheory, which can be taken as the extension of the conventional incompressible\nFlory-Huggins theory and is similar in simplicity. Using our complete theory,\nwe calculate the effects of size disparity and interactions on the\nthermodynamics of the model. Cohesive energies are not constant in general.\nNon-isometry can make the energy of mixing negative, even when all exchange\ninteractions are repulsive. Consequently, Scatchard-Hildebrand theory cannot be\nsubstantiated in general.

A special\nattention is paid to the case, where the density of two-level particles is high\nenough that a considerable part of the energy of relatively weak external\nlaser-fields can be coherently absorbed and reemitted by the medium. Thus, the\nfield of medium reaction plays a key role in the interaction processes, which\nleads to the collective behavior of an atomic ensemble in the strongly coupled\nlight-matter system. Such behavior results in the fast excitation interchanges\nbetween the field and a medium in the form of the optical ringing, which is\nanalogous to polariton beating in the solid-state optics. This collective\noscillating response, which can be treated as successive beats between light\nwave-packets of different group velocities, is shown to significantly affect\npropagation and amplification of the probe field under its nonlinear\ninteraction with a nearly copropagating pump pulse. Depending on the probe-pump\ntime delay, the probe transmission spectra show the appearance of either\nspecific doublet or coherent dip. The widths of these features are determined\nby the density-dependent field-matter coupling coefficient and increase during\nthe propagation. Besides that, the widths of the coherent features, which\nappear close to the resonance in the broadband probe-spectrum, exceed the\nabsorption-line width, since, under the strong-coupling regime, the frequency\nof the optical ringing exceeds the rate of incoherent relaxation.
