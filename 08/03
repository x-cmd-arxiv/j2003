The two\nvelocity fields only differ significantly in their monopole components. The\nmonopole discrepancy cannot be solely ascribed to shot-noise errors and\nincomplete sky coverage. The mismatch seems to arise from incompleteness of the\nPSCz catalog at fluxes $\\le$ 1.2 Jy. The 1.2-Jy and PSCz higher order velocity\nmultipoles, particularly the dipole and quadrupole components, appear to be\nconsistent, suggesting that the dipole residuals found by Davis, Nusser and\nWillick (1996) when comparing 1.2-Jy and MarkIII velocity fields probably\noriginates from the MarkIII velocities calibration procedure rather than from\nuncertainties in the model velocity field.
