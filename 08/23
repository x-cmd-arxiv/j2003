Within this picture the flavor-spin interaction\nbetween valence quarks inverts the $(1s)^4$ and $(1s)^3(1p)$ levels of the\nfour-quark subsystem and consequently the lowest-lying pentaquark is a positive\nparity, I=0, J=1/2 state of the flavor antidecuplet, similar to the soliton\nmodel prediction. Contrary to the soliton model, however, the quark picture\npredicts its spin-orbit partner with $J=3/2$. Different interpolating fields\nintended for lattice calculations of $\\Theta^+$ are constructed, which have a\nmaximal overlap with this baryon if it is indeed a quark excitation in the 5Q\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Aug 2003 16:56:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 24 Aug 2003 14:20:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}
