This tight constraint is obtained by\nnoting that of the two quasars which are lensed by foreground galaxies, neither\nare multiply imaged.

What is unknown is\nwhether HSPG associates with CSR in the absence of FGF-2. In this paper, we\ndetermine conditions by which pre-association would impact CSR-FGF-2-HSPG triad\nformation assuming diffusion-limited surface reactions. Using mean-field rate\nequations, we show that (i) when [HSPG] is much higher than [CSR], the presence\nof pre-formed complexes does not affect the steady state of FGF-2 binding, and\n(ii) when the concentrations are comparable, the presence of pre-formed\ncomplexes substantially increases the steady state concentration of FGF-2 bound\nto CSR. These findings are supported by explicit cellular automaton\nsimulations, which justify the mean-field treatment. We discuss the advantages\nof such a two-receptor system compared to a single receptor model, when the\nparameters are comparable. Further, we speculate that the observed high\nconcentration of HSPG in intact cells ([HSPG] ~ 100[CSR]) provides a way to\nensure that the binding levels of FGF-2 to its signaling receptor remains high,\nirrespective of the presence of pre-formed CSR-HSPG complexes on the cell\nsurface, while allowing the cell to finely tune the response to FGF-2 via\ndown-regulation of the signaling receptor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Aug 2003 13:12:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Since their discovery in\nlaboratory environments in 1994, such crystals have been the subject of a\nvariety of experimental, theoretical and numerical investigations. Most\nnumerical and theoretical investigations have examined infinite systems\nassuming periodic boundary conditions. Since experimentally observed crystals\ncan be comprised of a few hundred particles, this often leads to discrepancies\nbetween predicted theoretical results and experimental data. In addition,\nrecent studies have concentrated on the importance of random charge variations\nbetween individual dust particles, but very little on the importance of size\nvariations between the grains. Such size variations naturally lead to\ninter-grain charge variations which can easily become more important than those\ndue to random charge fluctuations (which are typically less than one percent).\nAlthough such size variations can be largely eliminated experimentally by\nintroducing mono-dispersive particles, many laboratory systems and all\nastrophysical environments contain significant size distributions.
