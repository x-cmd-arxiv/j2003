It is believed that some cold fronts\nare formed when a subcluster merges with another cluster and the ram pressure\nof gas flowing outside the subcluster gives the contact discontinuity the\ncharacteristic curved shape. While some edges may not arise directly from\nmergers (e.g., A496, Dupke & White, 2003), this paper focuses on those which\narise as contact discontinuities between a merging subcluster and the ambient\ncluster gas.

Since in a typical cluster or\ngroup (even an isothermal one) the entropy of the gas in the central regions is\nsignificantly lower than in the outer regions, the transport of the low entropy\ngas towards the interface and the associated adiabatic expansion makes the gas\ntemperature immediately inside the interface lower than in any other place in\nthe system, thus enhancing the temperature jump across the interface and making\nthe ``tip'' of the contact discontinuity cool.

To answer this question, we review the currently\npopular scenario of SN Ia progenitors, i.e., the single degenerate scenario for\nthe Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf (WD) models. We identify the progenitor's\nevolution with two channels: (1) the WD+RG (red-giant) and (2) the WD+MS (near\nmain-sequence He-rich star) channels. The strong wind from accreting WDs plays\na key role, which yields important age and metallicity effects on the\nevolution.\n  We suggest that the variation of the carbon mass fraction $X$(C) in the C+O\nWD (or the variation of the initial WD mass) causes the diversity of SN Ia\nbrightness. This model can explain the observed dependence of SNe Ia brightness\non the galaxy types. We then predict how SN Ia brightness evolves along the\nredshift (with changing metallicity and age) for elliptical and spiral\ngalaxies. Such evolutionary effects along the redshift can be corrected as has\nbeen made for local SNe Ia.\n  We also touch on several related issues: (1) the abundance pattern of stars\nin dwarf spheroidal galaxies in relation to the metallicity effect on SNe Ia,\n(2) effects of angular momentum brought into the WD in relation to the\ndiversities and the fate of double degenerates, and (3) possible presence of\nhelium in the peculiar SN Ia 2000cx in relation to the sub-Chandrasekhar mass\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Aug 2003 13:29:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Initial speculations on the origin\nof this emission pattern included supersonic ballistic transport of excitons\ndue to their dipole-dipole repulsion and Bose superfluidity of excitons. In\nthis paper we show that the ring effect is also observed in single quantum well\nstructures, where only direct excitons exist. More importantly, we find that\nthese experimental results are quantitatively explained by a novel coupled 2D\nelectron-hole plasma dynamics, namely, photoinduced in-plane charge separation.\nThis charge separation explains extremely long luminescence times that may be\nmore than a microsecond for the ring -- orders of magnitude longer than the\nemission lifetime of the excitons in the center spot. This method of\ncontinuously creating excitons may result in a highly dense exciton gas which\nis also well thermalized with the lattice (since the particles can cool over\nthe very long luminescence time after their hot optical creation), thus opening\nup opportunities for a detailed study of quantum statistics. The in-plane\nseparation of the charges into positive and negative regions, with a sharp\ninterface between them is an interesting new example of nonequilibrium dynamics\nand pattern formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Aug 2003 19:39:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Aug 2003 22:23:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

The Kerr black hole\ngravitational lens geometry consisting of an observer and a source located far\naway and placed at arbitrary inclinations with respect to the black hole's\nequatorial plane is studied in the strong field regime. For this geometry the\nnull geodesics equations of our interest can go around the black hole several\ntimes before reaching the observer. Such photon trajectories are written in\nterms of the angular positions in the observer's sky and therefore become \"lens\nequations\".

As an application, and to make contact with the literature, we\nconsider a supermassive Kerr black hole at the Galactic center as a\ngravitational deflector.

For all but\nseven nonnegative integers $n$ the largest degree of an algebraic number whose\nconjugates span a vector space of dimension $n$ is equal to $2^n n!$. The\nproof, which covers also the seven exceptional cases, uses a result of Feit on\nthe maximal order of finite subgroups of $GL_n(Q)$; this result depends on the\nclassification of finite simple groups. In particular, we construct an\nalgebraic number of degree 1152 whose conjugates span a vector space of\ndimension only 4.\n  We extend our results in two directions. We consider the problem when $Q$ is\nreplaced by an arbitrary field, and prove some general results. In particular,\nwe again obtain sharp bounds when the ground field is a finite field, or a\ncyclotomic extension of $Q$. Also, we look at a multiplicative version of the\nproblem by considering the analogous rank problem for the multiplicative group\ngenerated by the conjugates of an algebraic number.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Aug 2003 16:49:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 May 2004 13:21:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
