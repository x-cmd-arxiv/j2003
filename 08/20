The existence of\nthese TeV electrons strongly suggests that the shocks in SNRs are sources of\ngalactic cosmic rays (CRs). In addition, there is convincing evidence from\nbroad-band studies of individual SNRs and elsewhere that the particle\nacceleration process in SNRs can be efficient and nonlinear. If SNR shocks are\nefficient particle accelerators, the production of CRs impacts the thermal\nproperties of the shock heated, X-ray emitting gas and the SNR evolution. We\nreport on a technique that couples nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration,\nincluding the backreaction of the accelerated particles on the structure of the\nforward and reverse shocks, with a hydrodynamic simulation of SNR evolution.\nCompared to models which ignore CRs, the most important hydrodynamical effects\nof placing a significant fraction of shock energy into CRs are larger shock\ncompression ratios and lower temperatures in the shocked gas. We compare our\nresults, which use an approximate description of the acceleration process, with\na more complete model where the full CR transport equations are solved (i.e.,\nBerezhko et al., 2002), and find excellent agreement for the CR spectrum summed\nover the SNR lifetime and the evolving shock compression ratio.

This minimal\nHiggs choice provides a partial unification of neutrino flavor structure with\nthat of quarks and has been shown to predict all three neutrino mixing angles\nand the solar mass splitting in agreement with observations, provided one uses\nthe type II seesaw formula for neutrino masses. In this paper we generalize\nthis analysis to include arbitrary CP phases in couplings and vevs. We find\nthat (i) the predictions for neutrino mixings are similar with $U_{e3}\\simeq\n0.18$ as before and other parameters in a somewhat bigger range and (ii) that\nto first order in the quark mixing parameter $\\lambda$ (the Cabibbo angle), the\nleptonic mixing matrix is CP conserving. We also find that in the absence of\nany higher dimensional contributions to fermion masses, the CKM phase is\ndifferent from that of the standard model implying that there must be new\ncontributions to quark CP violation from the supersymmetry breaking sector.\nInclusion of higher dimensional terms however allows the standard model CKM\nphase to be maintained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Aug 2003 18:41:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We present a model-independent way to extract their energy\ndependence and static values from experiment, interpreting our findings also in\nterms of the low energy effective degrees of freedom inside the nucleon: The\npolarizabilities are dominated by chiral dynamics from the pion cloud, except\nfor resonant multipoles, where contributions of the Delta(1232) resonance turn\nout to be crucial. We therefore include it as an explicit degree of freedom.

A vortex soliton occurs robust with respect to symmetry-breaking\nmodulational instability in the self-defocusing regime provided that its radial\nprofile becomes flattened, so that a self-trapped wave beam gets a pronounced\nsurface. It is demonstrated that the dynamics of a slightly perturbed stable\nvortex soliton resembles an oscillation of a liquid stream having a surface\ntension. Using the idea of sustaining effective surface tension for spatial\nvortex soliton in a media with competing nonlinearities the explanation of a\nsuppression of the modulational instability is proposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Aug 2003 14:33:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

To quantify\nthe generation of entanglement, we calculate the purity ${\\cal P}(t)={\\rm\nTr}[\\rho_1(t)^2]$.
