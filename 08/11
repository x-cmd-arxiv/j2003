The sample was originally selected on the\nbasis of optical colors and spans a redshift range from 3.6 to 5.03. Our\nphotometry reflects the rest-frame\n  SED longward of Ly alpha for all redshifts. The results show that the near-IR\ncolors of high redshift quasars are quite uniform. We have modelled the\ncontinuum shape of the quasars (from just beyond Ly alpha to ~4000 A) with a\npower law of the form f_nu \\propto nu^alpha, and find <alpha > =-0.57 with a\nscatter of 0.33. This value is similar to what is found for lower redshift\nquasars over the same restframe wavelength range, and we conclude that there is\nhardly any evolution in the continuum properties of optically selected quasars\nup to redshift 5. The spectral indices found by combining near-IR with optical\nphotometry are in general consistent but slightly flatter than what is found\nfor the same quasars using the optical spectra and photometry alone, showing\nthat the continuum region used to determine the spectral indices can somewhat\ninfluence the results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Aug 2003 14:52:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

The deconvolution of the\ntransient signals was the major subject of the number of methods referred to\nunder the common name as the Deep Level Transient Spectroscopy methods. In\ngeneral the separation of the overlapping exponential decays C(t) does not\nprovide a unique solution, so the detection of the closely spaced deep levels\nby these transients should base mainly on the temperature dependence C(T), not\nonly on the C(t). The results show that the average emission factor en is\nobtainable directly from various correlation integrals of the capacitance\ntransients and the average activation energy E of the deep levels is detectable\nvia the shift operators of the transients according to the temperature. A new\nscanning technique is suggested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Aug 2003 14:12:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Another striking\nfeature of the nervous system is that spike based information transmission,\nwhich is supposed to be robust against noise, is noisy in itself: the variance\nof the spiking of the individual neurons is surprisingly large which may\ndeteriorate the adequate functioning of the Hebbian mechanisms. In this paper\nwe focus on networks in which Hebbian-like adaptation is induced only by\nexternal random noise and study spike-timing dependent synaptic plasticity.

The addition of\nCoulomb interactions result in asymmetries which modify the chemical and\nmechanical instability of the system and its equilibrium properties. These\nproperties are studied for systems with proton fraction $y$ on the proton\nricher side of the valley of $\\beta$-stability as well as the neutron rich\nside. Coulomb induced instabilities lead to proton diffusion processes on the\nproton richer side and also large asymmetries in chemical and mechanical\ninstabilities and coexistence curves. Considering the whole range of $0 \\le y\n\\le 1$, we can study how the symmetry about $y=1/2$ is broken by asymmetric\ninteraction and we can also explicitly show that the role between proton and\nneutron is exchanged around $y_E$. It is shown that there are two asymmetric\ncoexistence surfaces in $(y, P, T)$ space, one for $y < y_E$ and another for $y\n> y_E$ and touching each other at $y_E$. These asymmetries in instabilities\nshow up as new branches, one for $y < y_E$ and one for $y > y_E$, and thus form\na closed loop in pressure versus $\\rho$ for both chemical instability and\ncoexistence regions. The branch of $y > 1/2 > y_E$ was not previously\ninvestigated since only the $y < 1/2$ region is usually considered.
