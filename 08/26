Two of these stars,\nPG1544+488 and JL87, reveal extremely strong C III lines at 977 and 1176A,\nwhile the carbon lines are quite weak in the third star, LB1766. We have\nanalyzed the FUSE data using TLUSTY NLTE line-blanketed model atmospheres, and\nfind that PG1544+488 has a surface composition of 96% He, 2% C, and 1% N. JL87\nshows a similar surface enrichment of carbon and nitrogen, but some significant\nfraction of hydrogen still remains in its atmosphere. LB1766 has a surface\ncomposition devoid of hydrogen and strongly depleted of carbon, indicating that\nits surface material has undergone CN-cycle processing. We interpret these\nobservations with new evolutionary calculations which suggest that He-rich sdB\nstars with C-rich compositions are the progeny of stars which underwent a\ndelayed He-core flash on the white-dwarf cooling curve. During such a flash the\ninterior convection zone will penetrate into the H envelope, thereby mixing the\nenvelope with the He- and C-rich core. Such `flash-mixed' stars will arrive on\nthe extreme horizontal branch (EHB) with He- and C-rich surface compositions\nand will be hotter than the hottest canonical (i.e., unmixed) EHB stars. Two\ntypes of flash mixing are possible: `deep' and `shallow', depending on whether\nthe H envelope is mixed deeply into the site of the He flash or only with the\nouter layers of the core. Based on both their stellar parameters and surface\ncompositions, we suggest that PG1544+488 and JL87 are examples of `deep' and\n`shallow' flash mixing, respectively. Flash mixing may therefore represent a\nnew evolutionary channel for producing the hottest EHB stars. However, flash\nmixing cannot explain the abundance pattern in LB1766, which remains a\nchallenge to current evolutionary models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Aug 2003 16:39:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Oct 2003 22:18:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Our presentation is centered around the concept of the\nasymptotic linear spreading velocity v*, the asymptotic rate with which\ninitially localized perturbations spread into an unstable state according to\nthe linear dynamical equations obtained by linearizing the fully nonlinear\nequations about the unstable state. This allows us to give a precise definition\nof pulled fronts, nonlinear fronts whose asymptotic propagation speed equals\nv*, and pushed fronts, nonlinear fronts whose asymptotic speed v^dagger is\nlarger than v*. In addition, this approach allows us to clarify many aspects of\nthe front selection problem, the question whether for a given dynamical\nequation the front is pulled or pushed. It also is the basis for the universal\nexpressions for the power law rate of approach of the transient velocity v(t)\nof a pulled front as it converges toward its asymptotic value v*. Almost half\nof the paper is devoted to reviewing many experimental and theoretical examples\nof front propagation into unstable states from this unified perspective.

When the chemical potential is\npositive, it leads to a melt-like state. For a vanishingly low concentration of\nsegments, this state exhibits scaling behavior for long chains. The Flory\nexponent characterizing the radius of gyration for long chains is calculated to\nbe approximately 0.63, close to the classical value obtained for second order\nphase transitions. For short chains, the radius of gyration varies linearly\nwith $N$, the chain length, and is sensitive to the parameters in the\ninteraction potential. The linear dependence on the chain length $N$ indicates\na stiff behavior.

However, the symmetry\nbreaking induced by the top and bottom plates means that the true situation\nshould be a disconnected pitchfork. Indeed, experiments have shown that the\nfold of the disconnected branch can occur at more than double the Reynold's\nnumber of onset. This leads to an apparent contradiction: why should Taylor\nvortices set in so sharply at the value Reynold's number predicted by the\nsymmetric theory, given such large symmetry-breaking effects caused by the\nboundary conditions? This paper offers a generic explanation. The details are\nworked out using a Swift-Hohenberg pattern formation model that shares the same\nqualitative features as the Taylor-Couette flow. Onset occurs via a wall mode\nwhose exponential tail penetrates further into the bulk of the domain as the\ndriving parameter increases. In a large domain of length L, we show that the\nwall mode creates significant amplitude in the centre at parameter values that\nare O(L^{-2}) away from the value of onset in the problem with ideal boundary\nconditions. We explain this as being due to a Hamiltonian Hopf bifurcation in\nspace, which occurs at the same parameter value as the pitchfork bifurcation of\nthe temporal dynamics. The disconnected anomalous branch remains O(1) away from\nthe onset parameter since it does not arise as a bifurcation from the wall\nmode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Aug 2003 10:37:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
