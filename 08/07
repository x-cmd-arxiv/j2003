Such a large scaling of entanglement suggests that the effective\nconnectivity of the system diverges as the number of qubits goes to infinity\nand that this algorithm cannot be efficiently simulated by classical means. On\nthe other hand, entanglement in Grover's algorithm is bounded by a constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Aug 2003 15:00:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 2004 09:20:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
