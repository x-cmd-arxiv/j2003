Our simulations include both planetary \"embryos\" (defined as Moon to\nMars sized protoplanets) and planetesimals, assuming that the embryos formed\nvia oligarchic growth. We investigate volatile delivery as a function of\nJupiter's mass, position and eccentricity, the position of the snow line, and\nthe density (in solids) of the solar nebula.\n  In all simulations, we form 1-4 terrestrial planets inside 2 AU, which vary\nin mass and volatile content. In 42 simulations we have formed 43 planets\nbetween 0.8 and 1.5 AU, including 11 \"habitable\" planets between 0.9 and 1.1\nAU. These planets range from dry worlds to \"water worlds\" with 100+ oceans of\nwater (1 ocean = 1.5x10^24 g), and vary in mass between 0.23 and 3.85 Earth\nmasses.\n  There is a good deal of stochastic noise in these simulations, but the most\nimportant parameter is the planetesimal mass we choose, which reflects the\nsurface density in solids past the snow line. A high density in this region\nresults in the formation of a smaller number of terrestrial planets with larger\nmasses and higher water content, as compared with planets which form in systems\nwith lower densities.\n  We find that an eccentric Jupiter produces drier terrestrial planets with\nhigher eccentricities than a circular one. In cases with Jupiter at 7 AU, we\nform what we call \"super embryos,\" 1-2 Earth mass protoplanets which can serve\nas the accretion seeds for 2+ Earth mass planets with large water contents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Aug 2003 18:33:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-13"}

Our interest in this comes from a question of Grisha\nPerelman asked to the first author at a dinner in New York City on April 25th\nof 2003. His question was ``what happens to the Ricci flow on the 3-sphere when\none starts with an arbitrary metric? In particular does the flow become extinct\nin finite time?'' He then went on to say that one of the difficulties in\nanswering this is that he knew of no good way of constructing minimal surfaces\nfor such a metric in general. However, there is a natural way of constructing\nsuch surfaces and that comes from the min--max argument where the minimal of\nall maximal slices of sweep-outs is a minimal surface; see, for instance, [CD].\nThe idea is then to look at how the area of this min-max surface changes under\nthe flow. Geometrically the area measures a kind of width of the 3-manifold and\nas we will see for certain 3-manifolds (those, like the 3-sphere, whose prime\ndecomposition contains no aspherical factors) the area becomes zero in finite\ntime corresponding to that the solution becomes extinct in finite time.\nMoreover, we will discuss a possible lower bound for how fast the area becomes\nzero. Very recently Perelman posted a paper (see [Pe1]) answering his original\nquestion about finite extinction time. However, even after the appearance of\nhis paper, then we still think that our slightly different approach may be of\ninterest. In part because it is in some ways geometrically more natural, in\npart because it also indicates that lower bounds should hold, and in part\nbecause it avoids using the curve shortening flow that he simultaneously with\nthe Ricci flow needed to invoke and thus our approach is in some respects\ntechnically easier.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Aug 2003 12:41:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Aug 2003 15:03:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 15 Aug 2006 10:52:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
