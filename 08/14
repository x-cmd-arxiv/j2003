The\ntime structure of a GRB consists of pulses, superimposed or not, rising and\ndecreasing fast. The number of photons in a pulse, the pulses' widths and their\ntotal energy vary within broad but given ranges. Within a pulse, the energy\nspectrum softens with increasing time.

Looking for a method to study these coupling and mass\nparameters, we put forward the idea of the Multiple Point Principle as a first\nstep. This principle states that Nature adjusts the coupling and mass\nparameters so as to make many different vacuum states exist and have\napproximately the same energy densities (cosmological constants). As an\nillustrative application, we put up the proposal that a small increase (maybe\nonly an infinitesimal one) in the value of the top quark coupling constant\ncould lead to a new vacuum phase; in this new phase the binding of a bound\nstate of 6 top quarks and 6 anti-top quarks becomes so strong as to become a\ntachyon and condense in the vacuum. Assuming the existence of a third\ndegenerate vacuum at the fundamental energy scale, we present a solution to the\nhierarchy problem of why the ratio of the fundamental scale to the electroweak\nscale is so large.

Firstly, we give an\nelementary introduction to M-theory compactifications, which are obtained from\nan analysis of its low-energy effective theory, eleven-dimensional\nsupergravity. In particular, we show how the requirement of N=1 supersymmetry\nin four dimensions leads to compactifications on G_2-manifolds. We also examine\nthe Freund-Rubin solution as well as the M2- and M5-brane. Secondly, we review\nthe construction of realistic theories in four dimensions from\ncompactifications on G_2-manifolds. It turns out that this can only be achieved\nif the manifolds are allowed to carry singularities of various kinds. Thirdly,\nwe are interested in the concept of anomalies in the framework of M-theory. We\npresent some basic material on anomalies and examine three cases where\nanomalies play a prominent role in M-theory. We review M-theory on R^10 x\nS^1/Z_2 where anomalies are a major ingredient leading to the duality between\nM-theory and the E_8 x E_8 heterotic string. A detailed calculation of the\ntangent and normal bundle anomaly in the case of the M5-brane is also included.\nIt is known that in this case the normal bundle anomaly can only be cancelled\nif the topological term of eleven-dimensional supergravity is modified in a\nsuitable way. Finally, we present a new mechanism to cancel anomalies which are\npresent if M-theory is compactified on G_2-manifolds carrying singularities of\ncodimension seven. In order to establish local anomaly cancellation we once\nagain have to modify the topological term of eleven-dimensional supergravity as\nwell as the Green-Schwarz term.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Aug 2003 17:10:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In the Coulomb\nphase for the N=2* theory, G is broken to U(1)^r and the theory has monopole\nsolutions.

In the first instance the transformations yield nonquadratic model\nHamiltonians of degenerate multiphoton processes and define a class of non\nGaussian, nonclassical multiphoton states that exhibit properties of coherence\nand squeezing. We show that such homodyne multiphoton squeezed states are\ngenerated by unitary operators with a nonlinear time evolution that realizes\nthe homodyne mixing of a pair of conjugate quadratures.
