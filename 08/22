Any well behaved transform is also a solution. The problem is\nrelating the coordinates of the transform to observables. In the present case\nthe objective is to find T,R on a stationary frame that has the R be a physical\nobservable for all distances. We do this by working backwards, assuming the\nform of the metric that we desire, with some undetermined coefficients. These\ncoefficients are then related to the partial derivatives of the transform. The\ntransformed coordinates T,R are found by the integration of partial\ndifferential equations in the FLRW variables. We show that dR has the same\nunits as the radial differential of the FLRW metric, which makes it observable.\nWe develop a criterion for how close the transformed T comes to an observable\ntime. Close to the space origin at the present time, T also becomes physical,\nso that the stationary acceleration becomes Newtonian. We show that a galactic\npoint on a R,T plot starts close to the space origin at the beginning, moves\nout to a physical distance and finite time where it can release light that will\nbe seen at the origin at the present time. Lastly, because the observable R has\na finite limit at a finite T for t = 0 where the galactic velocity approaches\nthe light speed, we see that the universe filled with an ideal fluid as seen on\nclocks and rulers on the stationary frame has a finite extent like that of an\nexpanding empty universe, beyond which are no galaxies and no space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Aug 2003 18:14:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Aug 2003 22:33:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 13 Feb 2004 19:00:31 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 20 May 2004 22:58:33 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2011 19:01:03 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sun, 17 Apr 2011 01:27:43 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2011 19:23:55 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2013 18:14:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-23"}

The fluctuation in a\nquantity depends on the nature of the ensemble and contains at most n different\nfluctuation contributions, where is the number of fluctuating extensive\nquantities in the ensemble. We prove four general theorems and a corollary for\nstatistical fluctuations valid for any thermodynamic system. We also\ndemonstrate by two examples that the results of the theory remain valid\nregardless of the magnitude of the fluctuations. To avoid certain physical\nparadoxes, it is postulated that stationary metastable states like the ideal\nglass cannot exist in Nature. We also prove a generalized Nernst theorem valid\nat Nernst points at which certain susceptibility like the heat capacity\nvanishes. The theorem is no longer restricted to absolute temperature. We\ncalculate statistical fluctuations in the number of monomers and other physical\nquantities of interest in a compressible mixture. We demonstrate that the\ndensity and composition fluctuations are in general not statistically\nindependent, which is contrary to some recent claims. The standard isothermal\ncompressibility at constant monomer numbers does not represent the density\nfluctuation in all ensembles. We show that the density fluctuation at constant\ncomposition is a meaningless concept, except at absolute zero. We prove a\nrelation between the weighted monomer number fluctuation and the volume\nfluctuation in a multi-component system, which is an extension of a well-known\nsimilar relation for a single component system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Aug 2003 19:03:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We infer that the shape\nof the secondary neutron energy spectrum is virtually constant everywhere and\nat all times. We also measured the intensity of the 0.511 MeV electron-positron\nannihilation line. This line too varies with solar cycle and cutoff rigidity,\nbut its fall-off from low to high rigidity is less marked than that of the\nnuclear lines. This results from the energy dependences of the cross sections\nfor positron production and for the hadronic processes which which produce\nsecondary neutrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Aug 2003 20:15:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

It is true that they invalidate KS's account of the\ntheorem's physical implications. However, they do not invalidate Bell's point,\nthat quantum mechanics is inconsistent with the classical assumption, that a\nmeasurement tells us about a property previously possessed by the system. This\nfailure of classical ideas about measurement is, perhaps, the single most\nimportant implication of quantum mechanics. In a conventional colouring there\nare some remaining patches of white. MKC fill in these patches, but only at the\nprice of introducing patches where the colouring becomes ''pathologically''\ndiscontinuous. The discontinuities mean that the colours in these patches are\nempirically unknowable. We prove a general theorem which shows that their\nextent is at least as great as the patches of white in a conventional approach.\nThe theorem applies, not only to the MKC colourings, but also to any other such\nattempt to circumvent the Bell-KS theorem (Pitowsky's colourings, for example).\nWe go on to discuss the implications. MKC do not nullify the Bell-KS theorem.\nThey do, however, show that we did not, hitherto, properly understand the\ntheorem.
