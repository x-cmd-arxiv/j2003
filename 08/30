We utilized the 6.5m MMT AO system to produce\nhigh-resolution (FWHM=0.07'') near infrared (1.6 um) images of the young (~1\nMyr) Orion Trapezium theta 1 Ori cluster members. A combination of high spatial\nresolution and high signal to noise allowed the positions of these stars to be\nmeasured to within ~0.003'' accuracies. Including previous speckle data\n(Weigelt et al. 1999), we analyze a six year baseline of high-resolution\nobservations of this cluster. Over this baseline we are sensitive to relative\nproper motions of only ~0.002''/yr (4.2 km/s at 450 pc). At such sensitivities\nwe detect orbital motion in the very tight theta 1 Ori B2B3 (52 AU separation)\nand theta 1 Ori A1A2 (94 AU separation) systems. Such motions are consistent\nwith those independently observed by Schertl et al. (2003) with speckle\ninterferometry, giving us confidence that these very small (~0.002''/yr)\norbital motions are real. All five members of the theta 1 Ori B system appear\nlikely gravitationally bound. The very lowest mass member of the theta 1 Ori B\nsystem (B4) has K' ~11.66 and an estimated mass of ~0.2 Msun. There was very\nlittle motion (4+/-15 km/s) detected of B4 w.r.t B1 or B2, hence B4 is possibly\npart of the theta 1 Ori B group. We suspect that if this very low mass member\nis physically associated it most likely is in an unstable (non-hierarchical)\norbital position and will soon be ejected from the group. The theta 1 Ori B\nsystem appears to be a good example of a star formation ``mini-cluster'' which\nmay eject the lowest mass members of the cluster in the near future.

In the geometric case, results of joint\nwork with John Millson imply that the generating functions for the classes in\ncohomology of certain algebraic cycles of codimension r are Siegel modular\nforms of genus r and weight n/2+1. A result of Borcherds shows that, for r=1,\nthe same is true for the generating function for the classes of such divisors\nin the Chow group. By the Siegel-Weil formula, the generating function for the\nvolumes of codimension r cycles coincides with a value of a Siegel-Eisenstein\nseries of genus r.

The\nsecond part of the paper discusses the possible analogues of these results in\nthe arithmetic case, where the special values of derivatives of Eisenstein\nseries arise.
