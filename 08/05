NGC7814 is of particular interest because a\nprevious study estimated that it has 500-1000 GCs, giving it the largest\nspecific frequency (S_N) known for a spiral. Understanding this galaxy's GC\nsystem is important in terms of our understanding of the GC populations of\nspirals in general and has implications for the formation of massive galaxies.\nWe observed the galaxy in BVR filters with the WIYN 3.5-m telescope, and used\nimage classification and three-color photometry to select GC candidates. We\nalso analyzed archival HST WFPC2 images of NGC7814, both to help quantify the\ncontamination level of the WIYN GC candidate list and to detect GCs in the\ninner part of the galaxy halo. Combining HST data with high-quality\nground-based images allows us to trace the entire radial extent of this\ngalaxy's GC system and determine the total number of GCs directly through\nobservation. We find that rather than being an especially high-S_N spiral,\nNGC7814 has <200 GCs and S_N ~ 1, making it comparable to the two most\nwell-studied spirals, the Milky Way and M31. We explore the implications of\nthese results for models of the formation of galaxies and their GC systems. The\ninitial results from our survey suggest that the GC systems of typical\nellipticals can be accounted for by the merger of two or more spirals, but that\nfor highly-luminous ellipticals, additional physical processes may be needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Aug 2003 16:32:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

It is required that the spectral\nenergy distribution consist of thermal and Comptonized components. One can\nthen, in principle, infer the depth of the gravitational potential well for\nsources of known distance. The thermal component is inferred by the integration\nof a blackbody spectral form over the disk. We assume that the color\ntemperature distribution in the disk has a specific shape given by the\nShakura-Sunyaev (1973) disk model which goes to zero at the inner disk radius\nand at infinity and has a maximum at 4.2 Schwarzchild radii. In this\nformulation there is only one parameter, the so called color correction factor,\nrelating the apparent temperature to effective temperature which characterizes\nthe thermal emission component.

A binary model is\npresented to explain orbital light curves both for the high and low states as\nwell as the transition mechanism between them. The binary model consists of a\nwhite dwarf (WD), a disk around the WD, and a lobe-filling main-sequence (MS)\ncompanion. In the optical high state, the mass transfer rate to the WD exceeds\nthe critical rate of ~1 x 10^{-6} Msun/yr, and the WD blows an optically thick,\nmassive wind. Surface layers of the disk are blown in the wind and the disk\nsurface extends to the companion or over. As a result, optical luminosity of\nthe disk increases by a magnitude because of its large irradiation effect. The\nmassive wind completely obscures soft X-rays. This corresponds to the optical\nhigh/soft X-ray off state. The transition between optical high and low states\nis driven by an attenuation of the mass transfer from the secondary. As the\nmass supply stops, the WD wind weakens and eventually stops. The disk shrinks\nto a Roche lobe size and the optical magnitude drops. This phase corresponds to\nthe optical low/soft X-ray on state. This cycle is repeated like a limit cycle.\nThe WD can grow in mass at the critical rate and eventually reach the\nChandrasekhar mass limit. This process is called ``accretion wind evolution,''\nwhich is a key evolutionary process in a recently developed evolutionary\nscenario of Type Ia supernovae. This evolutionary process was first confirmed\nin the LMC supersoft X-ray source RX J0513.9$-$6951. Thus, V Sge is the second\nexample of accretion wind evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Aug 2003 07:40:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Using a segmentation algorithm, it has\nbeen reported that for heart beat data and Internet traffic fluctuations--the\ndistribution of durations of these stationary segments decays with a power law\ntail. A potential technical difficulty that has not been thoroughly\ninvestigated is that a nonstationary time series with a (scale-free) power law\ndistribution of stationary segments is harder to segment than other\nnonstationary time series because of the wider range of possible segment sizes.\nHere, we investigate the validity of a heuristic segmentation algorithm\nrecently proposed by Bernaola-Galvan et al. by systematically analyzing\nsurrogate time series with different statistical properties. We find that if a\ngiven nonstationary time series has stationary periods whose size is\ndistributed as a power law, the algorithm can split the time series into a set\nof stationary segments with the correct statistical properties. We also find\nthat the estimated power law exponent of the distribution of stationary-segment\nsizes is affected by (i) the minimum segment size, and (ii) the ratio of the\nstandard deviation of the mean values of the segments, and the standard\ndeviation of the fluctuations within a segment. Furthermore, we determine that\nthe performance of the algorithm is generally not affected by uncorrelated\nnoise spikes or by weak long-range temporal correlations of the fluctuations\nwithin segments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Aug 2003 03:37:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

To substantiate this belief, we\nhave designed and implemented an or-parallel tabling engine -- OPTYap -- and we\nused a shared-memory parallel machine to evaluate its performance. To the best\nof our knowledge, OPTYap is the first implementation of a parallel tabling\nengine for logic programming systems. OPTYap builds on Yap's efficient\nsequential Prolog engine. Its execution model is based on the SLG-WAM for\ntabling, and on the environment copying for or-parallelism.\n  Preliminary results indicate that the mechanisms proposed to parallelize\nsearch in the context of SLD resolution can indeed be effectively and naturally\ngeneralized to parallelize tabled computations, and that the resulting systems\ncan achieve good performance on shared-memory parallel machines. More\nimportantly, it emphasizes our belief that through applying or-parallelism and\ntabling to logic programs the range of applications for Logic Programming can\nbe increased.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Aug 2003 18:59:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
