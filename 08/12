Two kHz QPOs are usually detected in each star.\nBurst oscillations and two kHz QPOs have recently been detected in the 401 Hz\naccretion-powered X-ray pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658. In this star the frequency of\nthe burst oscillation is approximately equal to the star's spin frequency\nnu_spin whereas the frequency separation of the two kHz QPOs is approximately\nnu_spin/2. If as expected the frequency of the burst oscillations in other\nstars is also approximately nu_spin, the frequency separation is approximately\nnu_spin in some stars but approximately nu_spin/2 in others. A frequency\nseparation approximately equal to nu_spin/2 is unexplained in all existing\nmodels of the kHz QPOs. Here we propose a modified version of the sonic-point\nbeat-frequency model that can explain within a single framework why the\nfrequency separation is close to nu_spin in some stars but close to nu_spin/2\nin others. As in the original sonic-point model, the frequency nu_QPO2 of the\nupper kHz QPO is close to the orbital frequency nu_orb at the radius r_{sp} of\nthe sonic point in the disk flow. We show that magnetic and radiation fields\nrotating with the star will preferentially excite vertical motions in the disk\nat the \"spin-resonance'' radius r_{sr} where nu_orb - nu_spin is equal to the\nvertical epicyclic frequency, producing vertical motions in the disk that\nmodulate the X-ray flux at approximately nu_QPO2 - nu_spin or approximately\nnu_QPO2 - nu_spin/2, depending on whether the disk flow at r_{sr} is smooth or\nclumped. This sonic-point and spin-resonance model can also explain\nquantitatively the decrease of the kHz QPO frequency separation with increasing\naccretion rate that is observed in many sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Aug 2003 18:05:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This brings the total number of hosts of supernovae discovered (or\nindependently rediscovered) by KAIT, which have so far been classified on a\nhomogeneous system, to 408. The probability that SNe Ia and SNe II have a\ndifferent distribution of host galaxy Hubble types is found to be 99.7%. A\nsignificant difference is also found between the distributions of the host\ngalaxies of SNe Ia and of SNe Ibc (defined here to include SNe Ib, Ib/c, and\nIc). However, no significant difference is detected between the frequency\ndistributions of the host galaxies of SNe II and SNe IIn. This suggests that\nSNe IIn are generally not SNe Ia embedded in circumstellar material that are\nmasquerading as SNe II. Furthermore, no significant difference is found between\nthe distribution of the Hubble types of the hosts of SNe Ibc and of SNe II.\nAdditionally, SNe II-P and SNe II-L are found to occur among similar stellar\npopulations. The ratio of the number of SNe Ia-pec to normal SNe Ia appears to\nbe higher in early-type galaxies than it is in galaxies of later morphological\ntypes. This suggests that the ancestors of SNe Ia-pec may differ systematically\nin age or composition from the progenitors of normal SNe Ia. Unexpectedly, five\nSNe of Types Ib/c, II, and IIn (all of which are thought to have massive\nprogenitors) are found in host galaxies that are nominally classified as types\nE and S0. However, in each case the galaxy classification is uncertain, or\nnewly inspected images show evidence suggesting a later classification\n(abridged) ...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Aug 2003 21:34:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Aug 2003 06:42:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Consequently, interstellar helium ions contribute up\nto 50% of the total dynamic pressure of the ionized interstellar component. Up\nto now interstellar helium ions have been ignored in existing models of the\nheliospheric interface. In this paper we present results of a new model of the\nsolar wind interaction with the interstellar medium, which takes into account\ninterstellar helium ions. Using results of this model we find that the\nheliopause, termination and bow shocks are closer to the Sun when compared to\nthe model results that ignore $He$ ions. The influence of interstellar helium\nions is partially compensated by solar wind alpha particles, which are taken\ninto account in our new model as well. Finally, we apply our new model to place\nconstraints on the plausible location of the termination shock.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Aug 2003 14:48:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
