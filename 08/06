It can be easily shown that\nall separable states have the required extensions, so the non-existence of such\nan extension for a particular state implies that the state is entangled. One of\nthe main advantages of this approach is that searching for the extension can be\ncast as a convex optimization problem known as a semidefinite program (SDP).\nWhenever an extension does not exist, the dual optimization constructs an\nexplicit entanglement witness for the particular state. These separability\ntests can be ordered in a hierarchical structure whose first step corresponds\nto the well-known Positive Partial Transpose (Peres-Horodecki) criterion, and\neach test in the hierarchy is at least as powerful as the preceding one. This\nhierarchy is complete, in the sense that any entangled state is guaranteed to\nfail a test at some finite point in the hierarchy, thus showing it is\nentangled.
