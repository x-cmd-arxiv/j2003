The difficulty is that the class of systems to which the theory\ncan be applied is actually limited by the usual nonadditivity rule of entropy\nwhich is no more valid when the systems contain non uniform distribution of $q$\nvalues. In this paper, within the framework of the so called incomplete\ninformation theory, we propose a more general nonadditivity rule of entropy\nprescribed by the zeroth law of thermodynamics. This new nonadditivity\ngeneralizes in a simple way the usual one and can be proved to lead uniquely to\nthe $q$-entropy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 May 2003 17:45:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 May 2003 17:35:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 29 May 2003 14:36:59 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 4 Jun 2003 14:40:21 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2004 18:22:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
