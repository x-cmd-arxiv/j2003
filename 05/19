The column density of $c$-C$_3$H\nin the objects was estimated to be about one order of magnitude lower than that\nof the C$_3$H$_2$ which is ubiquitous in the galactic objects. The most\nprobable production mechanism of both the C$_3$H and C$_3$H$_2$ in dark clouds\nis a common dissociation reaction of C$_3$H$_3^+$ ion (Adams & Smith, 1987).\nAlthough the $c$-C$_3$H is 0.8 eV less stable than its isomer $l$-C$_3$H,\nfinding of comparable column densities of both the isomers in {TMC-1} supports\nthe idea of comparable formation of both the $c$-C$_3$H and $l$-C$_3$H in the\ncosmic objects.

The spin susceptibility is described in a form consistent with a\nphysical picture of Kondo lattices: Local spin fluctuations at different sites\ninteract with each other by a bare intersite exchange interaction, which is\nmainly composed of two terms such as the superexchange interaction, which\narises from the virtual exchange of spin-channel pair excitations of electrons\nacross the Mott-Hubbard gap, and an exchange interaction arising from that of\nGutzwiller's quasi-particles. The bare exchange interaction is enhanced by\nintersite spin fluctuations developed because of itself. The enhanced exchange\ninteraction is responsible for the development of superconducting fluctuations\nas well as the Cooper pairing between Gutzwiller's quasi-particles. On the\nbasis of the microscopic theory, we develop a phenomenological theory of\nlow-temperature superconductivity and pseudo-gaps in the under-doped region as\nwell as high-temperature superconductivity in the optimal-doped region.\nAnisotropic pseudo-gaps open mainly because of d\\gamma-wave superconducting\nlow-energy fluctuations: Quasi-particle spectra around (\\pm\\pi/a,0) and\n(0,\\pm\\pi/a), with a the lattice constant, or X points at the chemical\npotential are swept away by strong inelastic scatterings, and quasi-particles\nare well defined only around (\\pm\\pi/2a,\\pm\\pi/2a) on the Fermi surface or\nline.
