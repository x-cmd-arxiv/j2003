Though more than 150 HzRGs have been discovered up to now with this\ntecnique, little is known about its real effectiveness, as most of the ongoing\nsearches still have incomplete follow-up programs. By selecting a new\nappropriate sample of USS sources from the MRC survey, the true searching\nefficiency of the USS tecnique has been quantitatively demonstrated for the\nfirst time in this paper. Moreover it was compared with that of an optical\nsearch of HzRGs based on a simple cut of the galaxies r-band magnitude\ndistribution. When no bias other than the radio-spectrum steepness is applied,\nthe USS tecnique may be up to 4 times more efficient in selecting HzRGs with\nrespect to an optical search. Nevertheless, when the search is limited to\nobjects fainter than the POSS-II plates (r~21), the USS tecnique is still 2.5\ntimes more efficient (epsilonUSS =0.52 vs. epsilon_OPT= 0.19). For an optical\nsearch to reach a comparable efficiency it is necessary to select objects\nfainter than r=23, but this implies that about half of the HzRGs are lost\nbecause of the imposed magnitude bias. The advantage of the USS tecnique is\nthat a ~0.5 search efficiency is already reached at the POSS-II plates limit,\nwhere all the optical identification work is done without telescopes.

When possible, the results\nare compared with the exact diffusion Monte Carlo ones. A Jastrow type\ncorrelation provides a good description of the systems, both hard- and\nsoft-spheres, if the hypernetted chain energy functional is freely minimized\nand the resulting Euler equation is solved. The study of the soft-spheres\npotentials confirms the appearance of a dependence of the energy on the shape\nof the potential at gas paremeter values of $x \\sim 0.001$. For quantities\nother than the energy, such as the radial distribution functions and the\nmomentum distributions, the dependence appears at any value of $x$. The\noccurrence of a maximum in the radial distribution function, in the momentum\ndistribution and in the excitation spectrum is a natural effect of the\ncorrelations when $x$ increases. The asymptotic behaviors of the functions\ncharacterizing the structure of the systems are also investigated. The uniform\nlimit approach results very easy to implement and provides a good description\nof the soft-sphere gas. Its reliability improves when the interaction weakens.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 May 2003 16:26:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

However, the\nstorage capacity of the entire network then decreases. To overcome this\ndifficulty, we propose decreasing the connecting rate while keeping the total\nnumber of synapses constant by introducing delayed synapses. In this paper, a\ndiscrete synchronous-type model with both delayed synapses and their prunings\nis discussed as a concrete example of the proposal. First, we explain the\nYanai-Kim theory by employing the statistical neurodynamics. This theory\ninvolves macrodynamical equations for the dynamics of a network with serial\ndelay elements. Next, considering the translational symmetry of the explained\nequations, we re-derive macroscopic steady state equations of the model by\nusing the discrete Fourier transformation. The storage capacities are analyzed\nquantitatively. Furthermore, two types of synaptic prunings are treated\nanalytically: random pruning and systematic pruning. As a result, it becomes\nclear that in both prunings, the storage capacity increases as the length of\ndelay increases and the connecting rate of the synapses decreases when the\ntotal number of synapses is constant. Moreover, an interesting fact becomes\nclear: the storage capacity asymptotically approaches $2/\\pi$ due to random\npruning. In contrast, the storage capacity diverges in proportion to the\nlogarithm of the length of delay by systematic pruning and the proportion\nconstant is $4/\\pi$. These results theoretically support the significance of\npruning following an overgrowth of synapses in the brain and strongly suggest\nthat the brain prefers to store dynamic attractors such as sequences and limit\ncycles rather than equilibrium states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 May 2003 03:59:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

By comparing the\nexperimental curves with numerical simulations of the non-linear diffusion\nequation for the magnetic field we are able to resolve the crossover between a\ndissipative regime governed by flux creep and one dominated by flux flow\nphenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 May 2003 09:33:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

It is shown that the Hopf\n*-algebra O(SU_q(2)) of the quantum group SU_q(2) decomposes into an orthogonal\nsum of projective Hopf modules corresponding to irreducible integrable\n*-representations of the cross product algebras and that each irreducible\nintegrable *-representation appears with multiplicity one. The projections of\nthese projective modules are computed. The decompositions of tensor products of\nirreducible integrable *-representations with spin l representations of\nU_q(su_2) are given. The invariant state h on O(S^2_{qr}) is studied in detail.\nBy passing to function algebras over the quantum spheres S^2_{qr}, we give\nchart descriptions of quantum line bundles and describe the representations\nfrom the first approach by means of the second approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 May 2003 07:57:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Jul 2003 14:41:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2007 15:29:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-23"}

The\nscattered intensity distribution is recovered by a statistical analysis of the\nrandom interference of the light scattered in a half-plane of the scattering\nwave vectors and the main transmitted beam. High quality data can be obtained\nby proper statistical accumulation of scattered intensity frames, and the\nstatic stray light contributions can be eliminated rigorously. The\npotentialities of the method are tested in a scattering experiment from non\nequilibrium fluctuations during a free diffusion experiment. Contributions of\nlight scattered from length scales as long as Lambda=1 mm can be accurately\ndetermined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 May 2003 12:13:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

At the\nsame time electrodynamically trapped ions have been used with great success to\ndemonstrate quantum logic operations and are a candidate for scalable quantum\ncomputing. In this article a brief introduction is given to the basic steps\nthat constitute a quantum measurement; in particular, measurements on single\nquantum systems are considered. Then experiments with single Yb+ are reviewed\ndemonstrating the quantum Zeno paradox, as well as an experiment where an\nadaptive algorithm for quantum state estimation of qubits was implemented. In\nthe last section of this article -- devoted to experiments and new ideas\nrelated to quantum information processing (QIP) with trapped ions -- the\nrealization of various quantum channels using a hyperfine qubit of Yb+ is\nbriefly discussed. Then a concept for QIP with trapped ions is reviewed where\nrf or microwave radiation is used instead of laser light for coherent\nmanipulation of a collection of ions. In a suitably modified trap the ions form\nan artificial ion \"molecule\" to which the techniques developed in nuclear\nmagnetic resonance and electron spin resonance experiments can be directly\napplied. Finally, coherent excitation of optical electric quadrupole\ntransitions in Yb+ and Ba+ is reported. In addition, robust Raman cooling of a\npair of Ba+ ions is reviewed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 May 2003 07:43:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2004 14:46:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
