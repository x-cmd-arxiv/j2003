The simulations has been\nperformed both for hypothetical bodies with various parameters of trajectories\nas well as for all the major bodies of the solar system using the JPL ephemeris\nDE405/LE405 to calculate their motion.\n  It is shown that for the accuracy of $\\sim 0.2$ $\\mu$as it is sufficient to\nuse the well-known solution for the light propagation in the field of a\nmotionless mass monopole and substitute in that solution the position of the\nbody at the moment of closest approach between the actual trajectory of the\nbody and the unperturbed light path (as it was first suggested by Hellings\n(1986)).

Our most surprising conclusion is that in ordinary strong MHD\nturbulence the velocity and magnetic fields show different high-order structure\nfunction scalings. Moreover this scaling depends on whether the intermittency\nis viewed in a global or local system of reference. This reconciles seemingly\ncontradictory earlier results. On the other hand, the intermittency scaling for\nviscosity-damped turbulence is very different, and difficult to understand in\nterms of the usual phenomenological models for intermittency in turbulence. Our\nremaining results are in reasonable agreement with expectations. First, we find\nthat our high resolution simulations for ordinary MHD turbulence show that the\nenergy spectra are {\\it compatible} with a Kolmogorov spectrum, while\nviscosity-damped turbulence shows a shallow $k^{-1}$ spectrum for the magnetic\nfluctuations.

(In words, the induced\nsubgraph with respect to color $c$ is complete.) In this paper, we investigate\na variant of the Ramsey problem for the class of complete bipartite\nmultigraphs. (By a multigraph we mean a graph in which multiple edges, but no\nloops, are allowed.) Unlike the conventional m-coloring scheme in Ramsey theory\nwhich imposes a constraint (i.e., $m$) on the total number of colors allowed in\na graph, we introduce a relaxed version called m-local coloring which only\nrequires that, for every vertex $v$, the number of colors associated with $v$'s\nincident edges is bounded by $m$. Note that the number of colors found in a\ngraph under $m$-local coloring may exceed m. We prove that given any $n \\times\nn$ complete bipartite multigraph $G$, every shuffle-preserved $m$-local\ncoloring displays a monochromatic copy of $K_{p,p}$ provided that $2(p-1)(m-1)\n< n$. Moreover, the above bound is tight when (i) $m=2$, or (ii) $n=2^k$ and\n$m=3\\cdot 2^{k-2}$ for every integer $k\\geq 2$. As for the lower bound of $p$,\nwe show that the existence of a monochromatic $K_{p,p}$ is not guaranteed if\n$p> \\lceil \\frac{n}{m} \\rceil$. Finally, we give a generalization for\n$k$-partite graphs and a method applicable to general graphs. Many conclusions\nfound in $m$-local coloring can be inferred to similar results of $m$-coloring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 May 2003 16:17:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
