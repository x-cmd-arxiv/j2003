The angular resolution and\nsensitivity of modern space observatories give the opportunity to study the\nnonlinear electrodynamic effects, which can occur in very strong magnetic\nfields of pulsars ($B\\sim 10^{12}$ G) and magnetars ($B\\sim 10^{15}$ G). Such\nmagnetic field magnitudes are comparable with the typical value of magnetic\nfield induction necessary for manifestation of electrodynamics non-linearity in\nvacuum. Thus, near a magneticneutron star the electromagnetic emission should\nundergo nonlinear electrodynamic effects in strong magnetic fields (such as\nbending of rays, fluxes dispersing, changing of spectra and polarization\nstates). Manifestations of these effects in detected hard emission from\nmagnetic neutron stars are discussed on the base of nonlinear generalizations\nof the Maxwell equation in vacuum. The dispersion equations for electromagnetic\nwaves propagating in the magnetic dipole field were obtained in the framework\nof these theories.The possibility of observing the bending of a ray and gamma\nray flux dispersing in the neutron star magnetic field are analyzed. The only\nnonlinear electrodynamicseffect, which can be measured principally, is the\neffect of gamma ray flux dispersion by the neutron star magnetic field.\nStudying this effect we can also obtain information on the nonlinear\nelectrodynamics bending of a ray in the source. The main qualitative difference\nin predictions of different nonlinear electrodynamics theories are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 May 2003 07:02:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Hence, M is\neligible as a universal predictor in case of unknown mu. We investigate the\nexistence and convergence of computable universal (semi)measures for a\nhierarchy of computability classes: finitely computable, estimable, enumerable,\nand approximable.

Unfortunately this creates tremendous dependencies\nbetween packages which lead to brittle development systems (e.g., if the\nelectromagnetic code has a problem you may not be able to compile the tracking\ncode) and makes the storage system more complex.\n  We discuss how the CLEO III experiment avoided these problems by treating an\nevent as an object-relational database. The discussion will include: the\nconstraints we placed on our objects; our use of a separate Association class\nto deal with inter-object references; and our ability to use multiple sources\nto supply different data items for one event.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 May 2003 18:37:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Reconstructing the Ds+pi0 and Ds*+pi0 final\nstates in CLEO data, we observe peaks in both of the corresponding\nreconstructed mass difference distributions, dM(Dspi0)=M(Dspi0)-M(Ds) and\ndM(Ds*pi0)=M(Ds*pi0)-M(Ds*), both of them at values near 350 MeV. We interpret\nthese peaks as signatures of two distinct states, the DsJ*(2317)+ plus a new\nstate, designated as the DsJ(2463)+. Because of the similar dM values, each of\nthese states represents a source of background for the other if photons are\nlost, ignored or added.

Two\nconditions are found necessary to guarantee the above property of the single\nand double spurious states: The first is that no truncation in the\nsingle-particle space should be made.

The next decimation to the top of the\nFermi sea where standard nuclear physics is operative makes up the Fermi liquid\ndecimation. Thus nuclear dynamics is dictated by two fixed points, namely, the\nvector manifestation fixed point and the Fermi liquid fixed point. It has been\na prevalent practice in nuclear physics community to proceed with the second\ndecimation only, assuming density independent masses. We show why most nuclear\nphenomena can be reproduced by theories using either density-independent, or\ndensity-dependent masses, a grand conspiracy of nature that is an aspect that\ncould be tied to the Cheshire-Cat phenomenon in hadron physics.
