Previous studies have indicated that the corrections to the\nFermi-liquid forms of the specific heat and the static spin susceptibility\nscale as $T^{D}$ and $T^{D-1}$, respectively (with extra logarithms for\n$D=1,3$). In addition, the non-uniform spin susceptibility is expected to\ndepend on the bosonic momentum $Q$ in a non-analytic way, i.e., as $Q^{D-1}$\n(again with extra logarithms for $D=1,3$). It is shown that these non-analytic\ncorrections originate from the universal singularities in the dynamical bosonic\nresponse functions of a generic Fermi liquid. In contrast to the leading,\nFermi-liquid forms which depend on the interaction averaged over the Fermi\nsurface, the non-analytic corrections are parameterized by only two coupling\nconstants, which are the components of the interaction potential at momentum\ntransfers $q=0$ and $q=2k_F$.

The film surfaces interact\nwith the monomers via short ranged potentials and the wetting transition is of\nfirst order. If both surfaces in a film attract the same component, capillary\ncondensation occurs and the critical point is close to the critical point of\nthe bulk. If surfaces attract different components, an interface localization\noccurs which gives rise to phase diagrams with two critical points in the\nvicinity of the pre-wetting critical point. The crossover between these two\ntypes of phase diagrams as a function of the surface field asymmetry is\nstudied. We investigate the dependence of the phase diagram on the film\nthickness D for antisymmetric surface fields. Upon decreasing the film\nthickness the two critical points approach the symmetry axis of the phase\ndiagram, and below a certain thickness D_tri there remains only a single\ncritical point at symmetric composition. This corresponds to a second order\ninterface localisation transition even though the wetting transition is of\nfirst order. At a specific film thickness, D_tri, tricritical behavior is\nfound.

The essential principles are illustrated in a pedagogic model of a\ncomposite system with two spinless charged constituents, for which a dual\npicture for the low-energy resonance phenomena and high-energy scaling behavior\ncan be established. We introduce the concept of \"restricted locality\" of\nquark-hadron duality and show how this results in deviations from the pQCD\nquark counting rules above the resonance region. In particular it can be a\npossible source for oscillations about the smooth quark counting rule, as seen\ne.g. in the 90-degree differential cross sections for $\\gamma p\\to \\pi^+ n$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 May 2003 09:25:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 May 2003 20:42:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

An update begins with the creation of a\n``pool'' of K states at each time, by applying some Markov chain update to the\ncurrent state. These pools define an embedded HMM whose states are indexes\nwithin this pool. Using the forward-backward dynamic programming algorithm, we\ncan then efficiently choose a state sequence at random with the appropriate\nprobabilities from the exponentially large number of state sequences that pass\nthrough states in these pools. I show empirically that when states at nearby\ntimes are strongly dependent, embedded HMM sampling can perform better than\nMetropolis methods that update one state at a time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 May 2003 18:25:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We derive a model for correlated\nnoise channels that includes a channel memory state. We examine the case where\nthe memory is finite, and derive bounds on the classical and quantum\ncapacities. For the entanglement-assisted and unassisted classical capacities\nit is shown that these bounds are attainable for certain classes of channel.\nAlso, we show that the structure of any finite memory state is unimportant in\nthe asymptotic limit, and specifically, for a perfect finite-memory channel\nwhere no nformation is lost to the environment, achieving the upper bound\nimplies that the channel is asymptotically noiseless.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 May 2003 18:12:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Jan 2004 08:55:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
