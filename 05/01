Consequently, these measurements not only provide another\nquantitative confirmation of the importance of dark energy, but also constitute\na powerful qualitative test for the cosmological origin of cosmic acceleration.\nWe find a rate for SN Ia of 1.4+/-0.5E-04 h^3/Mpc^3/yr at a mean redshift of\n0.5. We present distances and host extinctions for 230 SN Ia. These place the\nfollowing constraints on cosmological quantities: if the equation of state\nparameter of the dark energy is w=-1, then H0 t0 = 0.96+/-0.04, and O_l - 1.4\nO_m = 0.35+/-0.14. Including the constraint of a flat Universe, we find O_m =\n0.28+/-0.05, independent of any large-scale structure measurements. Adopting a\nprior based on the 2dF redshift survey constraint on O_m and assuming a flat\nuniverse, we find that the equation of state parameter of the dark energy lies\nin the range -1.48<w<-0.72 at 95% confidence. If we further assume that w>-1,\nwe obtain w<-0.73 at 95% confidence. These constraints are similar in precision\nand in value to recent results reported using the WMAP satellite, also in\ncombination with the 2dF redshift survey.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 May 2003 01:27:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

At about the same time Riemann successfully applied the geometric\nmethods that he set up in his thesis (1851) to the study of Abelian integrals,\nand the solution of Jacobi inversion problem. In response to Riemann's\nachievements, by the early 1860s Weierstrass began to build the theory of\nanalytic functions in a systematic way on arithmetical foundations, and to\npresent it in his lectures. According to Weierstrass, this theory provided the\nfoundations of the whole of both elliptic and Abelian function theory, the\nlatter being the ultimate goal of his mathematical work. Riemann's theory of\ncomplex functions seems to have been the background of Weierstrass's work and\nlectures. Weierstrass' unpublished correspondence with his former student\nSchwarz provides strong evidence of this. Many of Weierstrass' results,\nincluding his example of a continuous non-differentiable function as well as\nhis counter-example to Dirichlet principle, were motivated by his criticism of\nRiemann's methods, and his distrust in Riemann's ``geometric fantasies''.\nInstead, he chose the power series approach because of his conviction that the\ntheory of analytic functions had to be founded on simple \"algebraic truths\".\nEven though Weierstrass failed to build a satisfactory theory of functions of\nseveral complex variables, the contradiction between his and Riemann's\ngeometric approach remained effective until the early decades of the 20$^{th}$\ncentury.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 May 2003 00:26:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
