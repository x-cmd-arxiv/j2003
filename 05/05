For the chemistry, we utilize the\nnew standard model (NSM) with the addition of deuterium fractionation and\ngrain-surface reactions treated via the modified rate approach. The use of\nsurface reactions distinguishes the present work from our previous model. We\nfind that these reactions efficiently produce H2O, H2CO, CH3OH, N2, and NH3\nices. In addition, the surface chemistry influences the gas-phase abundances in\na variety of ways. The current reaction network along with the L-P solution\nallows us to reproduce satisfactorily most of the molecular column densities\nand their radial distributions observed in L1544. The agreement tends to worsen\nwith models that include strongly delayed collapse rates. Inferred radial\ndistributions in terms of fractional abundances are somewhat harder to\nreproduce.
