These two sources of\nabsorption are to a good approximation uncorrelated because of their wide\nphysical separation. Therefore, the two-point correlation of absorption in this\nregion of quasar spectra neatly factorizes into two pieces: the Lyb correlation\nat high z, and the Lya correlation at low z. The latter can be independently\nmeasured from quasar spectra at lower redshifts using current techniques. A\nsimple division then offers a way to statistically separate out the Lyb\ntwo-point correlation from the Lya correlation. Several applications of this\ntechnique are discussed. First, since the Lyb absorption cross-section is lower\nthan Lya by about a factor of 5, the Lyb forest is a better probe of the\nintergalactic medium (IGM) at higher redshifts where Lya absorption is often\nsaturated. Second, for the same reason, the Lyb forest allows a better\nmeasurement of the equation of state of the IGM at higher overdensities,\nyielding stronger constraints on its slope when used in conjunction with the\nLya forest. Third, models of the Lya forest based on gravitational instability\nmake unique predictions for the Lyb forest, which can be tested against\nobservations. We briefly point out that feedback processes that affect higher\ndensity regions but leave low density structure intact may be better\nconstrained by the Lyb forest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 May 2003 19:02:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Feb 2004 23:14:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

At these densities, electrically\nneutral and weak-equilibrated quark matter can have unequal numbers of up,\ndown, and strange quarks. The QCD interaction favors Cooper pairs that are\nantisymmetric in color and in flavor, and a crystalline color superconducting\nphase can occur which accommodates pairing between flavors with unequal number\ndensities. In the crystalline color superconductor, quarks of different flavor\nform Cooper pairs with nonzero total momentum, yielding a condensate that\nvaries in space like a sum of plane waves. Rotational and translational\nsymmetry are spontaneously broken. We use a Ginzburg-Landau method to evaluate\ncandidate crystal structures and predict that the favored structure is\nface-centered-cubic. We predict a robust crystalline phase with gaps comparable\nin magnitude to those of the color-flavor-locked phase that occurs when the\nflavor number densities are equal.
