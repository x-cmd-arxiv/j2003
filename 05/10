This star shows a 6% semi-amplitude sinusoidal modulation of its flux\nat the orbital period of the system. It was proposed that the modulation arises\nfrom X-ray irradiation of the intrinsically faint companion by a remnant\naccretion disk, and that the bulk of the optical emission arises from viscous\ndissipation in the disk. The serious difficulty in this scenario lies in the\nestimate of the irradiating luminosity required to match the observational\ndata, that is a factor 10-50 higher than the quiescent X-ray luminosity of this\nsource. To overcome this problem, we propose an alternative scenario, in which\nthe irradiation is due to the release of rotational energy by the fast spinning\nneutron star, switched on, as magneto-dipole rotator (radio pulsar), during\nquiescence. Our computations indicate that the optical magnitudes are fully\nconsistent with this hypothesis. In this case the observed optical luminosity\nmay be the first evidence that a radio pulsar is active in this system in\nquiescence, a key phase for understanding the evolution of this class of\nobjects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 May 2003 16:00:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 May 2003 12:07:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Within those\nnonlinear structures, internal shocks are produced by infall of previously\nshocked gas to filaments and knots, and during subclump mergers, as well as by\nchaotic flow motions. Due to the low temperature of the accreting gas, the Mach\nnumber of external shocks is high, extending up to $M\\sim 100$ or higher. In\ncontrast, internal shocks have mostly low Mach numbers.

Three basic elements of the effect include: the refraction of\nneutrinos in matter, the resonance (level crossing) and the adiabaticity. The\nkey notion is {\\it the neutrino eigenstates} in matter. Physical picture of the\neffect is described in terms of the flavors and the relative phases of\neigenstates and the transitions between eigenstates. Features of the large\nmixing realization of the MSW effect are discussed. The large mixing MSW effect\n(LMA) provides the solution of the solar neutrino problem. We show in details\nhow this mechanism works. Physics beyond the LMA solution is discussed. The\nlower $Ar$-production rate (in comparison with the LMA prediction) and absence\nof significant \"turn up\" of the spectrum at low energies can be due to an\nadditional effect of the light sterile neutrino with very small mixing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 May 2003 17:17:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Including transverse flow of soft partons\nand independent fragmentation of minijet partons, the model is able to describe\navailable experimental data on pion, kaon, and antiproton spectra. The\nresulting antiproton to pion ratio is seen to increase at low transverse\nmomenta and reaches a value of about one at intermediate transverse momenta, as\nobserved in experimental data at RHIC. A similar dependence of the antikaon to\npion ratio on transverse momentum is obtained, but it reaches a smaller value\nat intermediate transverse momenta. At high transverse momenta, the model\npredicts that both the antiproton to pion and the antikaon to pion ratio\ndecrease and approach those given by the perturbative QCD. Both collective flow\neffect and coalescence of minijet partons with partons in the quark-gluon\nplasma affect significantly the spectra of hadrons with intermediate transverse\nmomenta.
