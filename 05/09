A turbulent cascade is one possible way of\ngenerating small-scale fluctuations from a pre-existing population of\nlow-frequency MHD waves. We model this cascade as a combination of advection\nand diffusion in wavenumber space. The dominant spectral transfer occurs in the\ndirection perpendicular to the background magnetic field.

The emission is brightest in the cavities defined by expanding\nshells detected previously in H alpha emission (Martin 1998). Thermal emission\nmodels fitted to the data imply temperatures ranging from ~1.3 to 4.9 x 10^(6)\nK and indicate that the strongest absorption is coincident with the densest\nclouds traced by CO emission. The fitted emission measures give pressures of\nP/k~10^(5-6) xi^(-0.5) f_(v)^(-0.5) K cm^(-3) (xi: metallicity of the hot gas\nin solar units, f_(v): volume filling factor). Despite these high pressures,\nthe radial density profile of the hot gas is not as steep as that expected in a\nfreely expanding wind (e.g., as seen in the neighboring starburst galaxy M 82)\nimplying that the hot gas is still confined by the H alpha shells. The chaotic\ndynamical state of NGC 3077 undermines reliable estimates of the escape\nvelocity. The more relevant quantity for the ultimate fate of the outflow is\nprobably the gas density in the rich intragroup medium.

We propose that the CP is caused by Faraday conversion\nof linear polarisation synchrotron light which propagates along a line-of-sight\nthrough helical magnetic fields. Jet outflows from radio galaxies should have\nthe required magnetic helicity in the emission region due to the magnetic\ntorque of the accretion disc. Also advection dominated accretion flow (ADAF)\nshould contain magnetic fields with the same helicity. However, a jet region\nseems to be the more plausible origin of CP. The proposed scenario requires\nFaraday rotation (FR) to be insignificant in the emission region. The proposed\nmechanism works in electron-positron e+/e- as well as electron-proton e/p\nplasma. In the latter case, the emission region should consist of individual\nflux tubes with independent polarities in order to suppress too strong FR - as\nit was already proposed for FR based CP generation models. The predominant CP\nis expected to mostly counter-rotate (rotation is measured here in\nsky-projection) with respect to the central engine in all cases (jet or ADAF,\ne+/e- or e/p plasma) and therefore allows to measure the sense of rotation of\nquasar engines. The engine of SgrA* is expected - in this scenario - to rotate\nclockwise and therefore counter-Galactic, as do the young hot stars in its\nvicinity, which are thought to feed SgrA* by their winds.
