We show analytically that, under these conditions, charge and mass\nconservation constrain the mass of 56Ni produced to depend linearly on the\noriginal metallicity of the white dwarf progenitor.

In order to probe the near-infrared light at\nhigh redshifts, we surveyed the field with the broad band LW2 (5-8.5um) filter\nof the mid-infrared camera ISOCAM. Adopting a highly redundant imaging strategy\nfor the 23 hour observation and carefully treating gradual changes in the\ndetector responsivity caused by a very high rate of cosmic ray impacts, we\nsucceeded in reaching an 80% completeness limit of 16uJy in the central 7\narcmin2 region. Utilizing the signal-to-noise ratio map, we detected 65 sources\ndown to 6uJy in the 16 arcmin2 field. Integral galaxy number counts at 6.7um\nare then derived, reaching 1.3e4/deg2 at the faint limit with a slope of -1.6\nbetween 13uJy and 130uJy. Integrating individual sources in this flux range,\nthe resolved fraction of the extragalactic background light at 6.7um is\nestimated to be 0.56nW/m2/sr. These results, which reach a flux limit three\ntimes fainter than those in the Hubble Deep Fields, are in fairly good\nagreement with a model prediction by Franceschini et al. (1997). Finally, we\ndiscuss the relation of distant massive E/S0 galaxies to the faint 6.7um galaxy\npopulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 May 2003 02:40:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 14 Jun 2003 05:03:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The main\nfeature of the proposed wavefunction is the presence of the antisymmetric\ngeminal part together with a Jastrow factor. Both the geminal and the Jastrow\nplay a crucial role in determining the remarkable accuracy of the many-body\nstate: the former permits the correct treatment of the nondynamic correlation\neffects, the latter allows the wavefunction to fulfill the cusp conditions and\nmakes the geminal expansion rapidly converging to the lowest possible\nvariational energies. This ansatz is expected to provide a substantial part of\nthe correlation energy for general complex atomic and molecular systems. The\nantisymmetric geminal term can be written as a single determinant even in the\npolarized cases. In general, therefore, the computational effort to sample this\ncorrelated wavefunction is not very demanding. We applied this Jastrow-geminal\napproach to atoms up to Z=15, always getting good variational energies, by\nparticularly improving those with a strong multiconfigurational nature. Our\nwavefunction is very useful for Monte Carlo techniques, such as Fixed node.\nIndeed, the nodal surface obtained within this approach can be substantially\nimproved through the geminal expansion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 May 2003 13:09:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

But what is mass\n? Is it scalar or vector ? Apparently it appears that mass is scalar; but\nrelativistic mass is velocity dependent and moving mass such as photon is\nvector boson. In the present paper a new concept is introduced that in general,\nmass is neither scalar nor vector rather, mass is a quaternion quantity (scalar\n+ vector). The concept of quaternion mass suggests that the total mass M of a\nmoving body is quaternion sum of : (i) the scalar(grain or rest mass) mass mg\nestablishing its particle behavior and (ii) the vector(photonic) mass mp\ngoverning its wave properties. Mathematically, total quaternion mass as M = mg\n+ mp, its magnitude being the Pythagorean sum as |M| = (mg2+mp2)1/2 .
