The\nR_V dependent CCM relationship and the sample of extinction curves used to\nderive this relationship is used to describe the general behavior of Milky Way\nextinction curves. The ultraviolet portion of the SMC and LMC extinction curves\nare derived from archival IUE data, except for one new SMC extinction curve\nwhich was measured using HST/STIS observations. The optical extinction curves\nare derived from new (for the SMC) and literature UBVRI photometry (for the\nLMC). The near-infrared extinction curves are calculated mainly from 2MASS\nphotometry supplemented with DENIS and new JHK photometry. For each extinction\ncurve, we give R_V = A(V)/E(B-V) and N(HI) values which probe the same dust\ncolumn as the extinction curve. We compare the properties of the SMC and LMC\nextinction curves with the CCM relationship three different ways: each curve by\nitself, the behavior of extinction at different wavelengths with R_V, and\nbehavior of the extinction curve FM fit parameters with R_V. As has been found\npreviously, we find that a small number of LMC extinction curves are consistent\nwith the CCM relationship, but majority of the LMC and all of the SMC curves do\nnot follow the CCM relationship. For the first time, we find that the CCM\nrelationship seems to form a bound on the properties of all of the LMC and SMC\nextinction curves. This result strengthens the picture of dust extinction\ncurves exhibit a continuum of properties between those found in the Milky Way\nand the SMC Bar.

It is found that the abundance ratio of F/O declines as\nthe oxygen abundance decreases. The values of F/O are especially low in the two\nOmega Cen giants; this very low value of F/O probably indicates that 19F\nsynthesis in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars is not the dominant source of\nfluorine in stellar populations. The observed decline in F/O with lower O\nabundances is in qualitative agreement with what is expected if 19F is produced\nvia H- and He-burning sequences in very massive stars, with this fluorine then\nejected in high mass-loss rate Wolf-Rayet winds.

However, to find the preferred choice\nwhen the expected utility interval of one choice is included in that of\nanother, it is necessary to interpolate a discerning point in the intervals.\nThis is done by the parameter rho, defined as the probability that the\nambiguity about the utility of every nonsingleton focal element will turn out\nas favorable as possible.

A graph G is very\nwell-covered (Favaron, 1982) if it has no isolated vertices, its order equals\n2*alpha(G), where alpha(G) is the size of a maximum stable set, and it is\nwell-covered (i.e., all its maximal independent sets are of the same size,\nPlummer, 1970). For instance, appending a single pendant edge to each vertex of\nG yields a very well-covered graph, which we denote by G*. Under certain\nconditions, any well-covered graph equals G* for some G (Finbow, Hartnell and\nNowakowski, 1993).

For a system\nof $m$ particles, each with $N$ distinct states, we prove that $\\rho$ is\n$m$-particle negative partial transpose (NPT) entangled, if there exists a\nmaximally entangled state $|{\\rm MES}>$, such that $<{\\rm MES}|\\rho|{\\rm\nMES}>>{1}/{N}$. While this sufficiency condition is weaker than the\nPeres-Horodecki criterion in all cases, it applies to multi-particle systems,\nand becomes especially useful when the number of particles ($m$) is large. We\nalso consider the converse of this criterion and illustrate its invalidity with\ncounter examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 May 2003 15:50:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
