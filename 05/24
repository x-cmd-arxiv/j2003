We investigate the uncertainty in the orbital\nsolutions that have been fit to these observations. Understanding these\nuncertainties will become more and more important as the discovery space for\nextrasolar planets shifts to longer and longer periods. While detections of\nshort period planets can be rapidly refined, planets with long orbital periods\nwill require observations spanning decades to constrain the orbital parameters\nprecisely. Already in some cases, multiple distinct orbital solutions provide\nsimilarly good fits, particularly in multiple planet systems. We present a\nmethod for quantifying the uncertainties in orbital fits and addressing\nspecific questions directly from the observational data rather than relying on\nbest fit orbital solutions. This Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique has\nthe advantage that it is well suited for the high dimensional parameter spaces\nnecessary for the multiple planet systems. We apply the MCMC technique to\nseveral extrasolar planetary systems, assessing the uncertainties in orbital\nelements for several systems. Our MCMC simulations demonstrate that for some\nsystems there are strong correlations between orbital parameters and/or\nsignificant non-Gaussianities in parameter distributions, even though the\nmeasurement errors are nearly Gaussian. Once these effects are considered the\nactual uncertainties in orbital elements can be significantly larger or smaller\nthan the published uncertainties.

The\ndynamics of the system is treated in the experimentally relevant collisionless\nregime by means of a Random-Phase approximation and the behavior of a\nmesoscopic cloud under isotropic harmonic confinement is contrasted with that\nof a macroscopic mixture at given average particle densities.

The manifest translational\nsymmetry breaking, eventually due to some gravitational and/or matter fields in\nfive dimensions, is effectively realized with the help of background scalar\ndefects.

Here, we consider the case of superoscillating wave functions\nin quantum mechanics. We find that they possess rather unusual properties which\nraise measurement theoretic, thermodynamic and information theoretic issues. We\nexplicitly determine the wave functions with the most pronounced\nsuperoscillations, together with their scaling behavior. We also address the\nquestion how superoscillating wave functions could be produced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 May 2003 04:34:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

These\ncorrelations are predicted by quantum mechanics and they are confirmed by\nAspect type experiments for testing of Bell inequality. The presence of these\nnonlocal correlations in the framework of a local field theory is connected\nwith the fact that its solution is nonlocal in character.

This paper identifies some of the commutation and\nderivation structures that arise in particle and field interactions and\nfundamental symmetries. The requirements of coexisting structures, and their\nconsistency, produce a mathematical framework that underlies a fundamental\nphysics theory. Among other developments in Quantum theory of particles and\nfields are the symmetries of gauge fields and the Fermi-Bose symmetry of\nparticles. These involve a gauge covariant derivation and the action\nfunctionals; and commutation algebras and Bogoliubov transforms. The non\ncommutative Theta form introduces an additional and fundamental structure. This\npaper obtains the interrelations of various structures, and the conditions for\nthe symmetries of Fermionic/Bosonic particles interacting with Yang Mills gauge\nfields. Many example physical systems are being solved, and the mathematical\nformalism is being created to understand the fundamental basis of physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 May 2003 11:37:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The accuracy is verified and it is shown that\nfor high photon number it fails to reproduce the true distribution.
