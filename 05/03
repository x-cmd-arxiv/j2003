We review, with a strong\nfocus on results obtained by torque magnetometry, how this leads to a complex\nbehavior of the anisotropic superconducting state properties. The different\ndimensionality of the two sets of bands is manifested in the upper critical\nfield Hc2 anisotropy, which was found to strongly decrease with increasing\ntemperature. While the angular dependence of Hc2 follows roughly the\npredictions of anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau theory AGLT, small, but systematic\ndeviations were observed near Tc. This, and the temperature dependent\nanisotropy, witness a breakdown of the AGLT description of MgB2, even close to\nTc. Theoretical calculations are in qualitative agreement with the observed\nangle dependence, but suggest a much lower penetration depth anisotropy at low\ntemperatures. Reversible torque vs angle curves in the mixed state indicate\nthat the penetration depth anisotropy in intermediate fields has to be higher\nthan currently available theoretical estimates. The observed field dependent\neffective anisotropies can be accounted for qualitatively by the faster\ndepression of superconductivity in the more isotropic bands by the applied\nfield.

To test\nthis approach, a one-dimensional, yet realistic, nucleon-nucleon potential is\nintroduced. An effective potential is then constructed by tuning its parameters\nto reproduce the exact effective-range expansion and a variety of bare\noperators are renormalized in a fashion compatible with this construction.\nPredictions for the expectation values of these effective operators in the\nground state reproduce the results of the exact theory with remarkable accuracy\n(at the 0.5% level). This represents a marked improvement over a widely\npracticed approach that uses effective interactions but retains bare operators.\nFurther, it is shown that this improvement is more impressive as the operator\nbecomes more sensitive to the short-range structure of the potential. We\nillustrate the main ideas of this work using the elastic form factor of the\ndeuteron as an example.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 May 2003 21:49:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
