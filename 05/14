Basically, the\nproblem is one of selection bias, with galaxy forming regions being\nunrepresentative of the dark matter distribution in a way not described by\nlinear bias. Knowledge of the optical PDF and the plausible assumption of a\nlog-normal distribution for the matter PDF will allow one to correct for these\nselection biases.

This is a\nsimilar, but stronger, feature to that which we found in 1H0707-495.\nSignificant flattening of the hard X-ray spectrum occurs when the source flux\ndecreases. The flattening of the spectrum can be modelled as an increase in the\ncolumn density of the absorbing material and/or its covering fraction. Below ~\n1.5 keV the spectrum is dominated by a giant soft X-ray excess, and at around ~\n1.2 keV there is a significant absorption feature detected, most probably due\nto ionized Fe L absorption.

Using the so-called Response\nFunctions (RFs) of Tripicco & Bell (1995, TB95), we calculate the indices for\nSSPs of different age, metallicity and enhancement. We made use of the triplet\nHb, Mgb and <Fe>, and Minimum-Distance Method proposed by Trager et al.

Since very large differences are found, in\nparticular as far as the age is concerned, we analyze in a great detail all\npossible sources of disagreement, going from the stellar models and SSPs to\nmany technical details of the procedure to calculate the indices, and finally\nthe pattern of chemical elements (especially when alpha-enhanced mixtures are\nadopted). The key issue of the analysis is that at given metallicity Z and\nenhancement factor, the specific abundance ratios [Xel/Fe] adopted for some\nelements (e.g. O, Mg, Ti, and likely others) dominate the scene because with\nthe TB95 RFs they may strongly affect indices like Hb and the age in turn.\nFinally we have drawn some remarks on the interpretation of the distribution of\nearly-type galaxies in popular two-indices planes, like Hb vs. [MgFe]. We argue\nthat part of the scatter along the Hb axis observed in this plane could be\nattributed instead of the age, the current explanation, to a spread both in the\ndegree of enhancement and some abundance ratios. The main conclusion of this\nstudy is that deriving ages, metallicities and degree of enhancement from line\nindices is a cumbersome affair whose results are still uncertain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 May 2003 12:50:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 May 2003 15:34:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2004 13:45:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The effect is\nsmall for pinning controlled and large for nucleation controlled magnets. The\neffect is strongly dependent on the demagnetization factor and may reach nearly\n100 per cent in SmCo5 samples measured in a closed circuit. The TR is very\nsensitive to a small superimposed steady field. The maximum effect and the\nposition of the peak is dependent on the initial temperature. The direction of\nthe TR is correlated with the temperature coefficient of the coercivity,\nresulting in a inverse TR in barium ferrite. The susceptibility of the\nthermally remagnetized samples is increased. Repeated cycles of steady-field\ndemagnetization followed by heating result in the same TR. The phenomenology of\nTR and ITR is explained by means of a model taking into account both the\ninternal field fluctuations due to grain interactions and the decay of single\ndomain grains into multi-domain state. By taking the measured temperature\ndependencies of the coercivity and the saturation magnetization the theory is\nable to reproduce the experiments very well, allowing to determine the width of\nthe field fluctuations, the width of the switching field distribution and an\ninternal demagnetization factor as characteristics of the materials by fitting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 May 2003 17:31:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

For a given quasi-projectile produced in reactions\nwith different targets no isoscaling is observed. The isoscaling thus reflects\nthe level of N/Z-equilibration in reactions with different targets represented\nby the initial quasi-projectile samples. The excitation energy dependence of\nthe isoscaling parameter beta_prime, corrected for the trivial 1/T temperature\ndependence, does not follow the trend of the homogeneous system above 4\nMeV/nucleon thus possibly signaling the onset of separation into isospin\nasymmetric dilute and isospin symmetric dense phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 May 2003 18:39:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Oct 2003 07:19:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 12 Feb 2004 08:10:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

By introducing a cutoff in momentum\nspace, we separate the Hilbert space into a low momentum and a high momentum\npart. The renormalization group is used to construct the effective interaction\nV_{low k} in the low momentum space, starting from various high precision\npotential models commonly used in nuclear many-body calculations. With a cutoff\nin the range of $\\Lambda ~ 2.1 fm^{-1}$, the new potential V_{low k} is\nindependent of the input model, and reproduces the experimental phase shift\ndata for corresponding laboratory energies below $E_{lab} ~ 350 MeV$, as well\nas the deuteron binding energy with similar accuracy as the realistic input\npotentials. The model independence of V_{low k} demonstrates that the physics\nof nucleons interacting at low momenta does not depend on details of the high\nmomentum dynamics assumed in conventional potential models. V_{low k} does not\nhave momentum components larger than the cutoff, and as a consequence is\nconsiderably softer than the high precision potentials. Therefore, when V_{low\nk} is used as microscopic input in the many-body problem, the high momentum\neffects in the particle-particle channel do not have to be addressed by\nperforming a Brueckner ladder resummation or short-range correlation methods.\nBy varying the cutoff, we study how the model independence of V_{low k} is\nreached in different partial waves. This provides numerical evidence for the\nseparation of scales in the nuclear problem, and physical insight into the\nnature of the low momentum interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 May 2003 16:08:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

It appears that the attack could be applied to any protocol that relies\non manipulation and return of entangled qubits to create a shared key. The\nprotocols that are cryptanalyzed in this paper were proven secure with respect\nto some eavesdropping approaches, and results reported here do not invalidate\nthese proofs. Rather, they suggest that quantum cryptographic protocols, like\nconventional protocols, may be vulnerable to methods of attack that were not\nenvisaged by their designers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 May 2003 15:46:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
