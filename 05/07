This supports the\nidea that such power-laws are a direct consequence of gas cooling in a\ngravitational potential. In the cluster atmosphere hot bubbles of gas injected\nby the AGN are rising buoyantly.

Such an unusual fluid\nobject is a thin spherical air shell surrounding a liquid globule. We explain\nhow to produce them and we study their stability. By overweighting antibubbles\nwith a small amount of salt, they sink and pop at a definite depth. A critical\ndepth related to a critical pressure has been found. A modified Laplace law\ndescribes the air shell thickness evolution with respect to pressure. This law\ncombined with surfactant layers interaction allows to explain the critical\ndepth for antibubble stability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 May 2003 08:22:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The production of vector mesons\n($\\rho,\\omega$) is described via the excitation of nuclear resonances ($R$).\nThe theoretical framework is an extended vector meson dominance model (eVMD).\nThe treatment of the resonance decays $R\\longmapsto NV$ with arbitrary spin is\ncovariant and kinematically complete. The eVMD includes thereby excited vector\nmeson states in the transition form factors. This ensures correct asymptotics\nand provides a unified description of photonic and mesonic decays. The\nresonance model is successfully applied to the $\\omega$ production in $p+p$\nreactions. The same model is applied to the dilepton production in elementary\nreactions ($p+p, p+d$). Corresponding data are well reproduced. However, when\nthe model is applied to heavy ion reactions in the BEVALAC/SIS energy range the\nexperimental dilepton spectra measured by the DLS Collaboration are\nsignificantly underestimated at small invariant masses. As a possible solution\nof this problem the destruction of quantum interference in a dense medium is\ndiscussed. A decoherent emission through vector mesons decays enhances the\ncorresponding dilepton yield in heavy ion reactions. In the vicinity of the\n$\\rho/\\omega$-peak the reproduction of the data requires further a substantial\ncollisional broadening of the $\\rho$ and in particular of the $\\omega$ meson.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 May 2003 12:11:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}
