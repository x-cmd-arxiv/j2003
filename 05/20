A total of 57 variable stars was found including 38 RR Lyrae\nstars, 6 Population II Cepheids, and 12 long period variables. Of the RR Lyrae\nstars observed in this survey, 26 are pulsating in the fundamental mode with a\nmean period of 0.753d and 12 are first-overtone mode pulsators with a mean\nperiod of 0.365d. These values match up very well with those found in\nground-based surveys. Combining all the available data for NGC 6441, we find\nmean periods of 0.759d and 0.375d for the RRab and RRc stars, respectively. We\nalso find that the RR Lyrae in this survey are located in the same regions of a\nperiod-amplitude diagram as those found in ground-based surveys. Although NGC\n6441 is a metal-rich globular cluster, its RR Lyrae more closely resemble those\nin Oosterhoff type II globular clusters. However, even compared to typical\nOosterhoff type II systems, the mean period of its RRab stars is unusually\nlong. We also derived I-band period-luminosity relations for the RR Lyrae\nstars. Of the six Population II Cepheids, five are of W Virginis type and one\nis a BL Herculis variable stars. This makes NGC 6441, along with NGC 6388, the\nmost metal-rich globular cluster known to contain these types of variable\nstars. Another variable, V118, may also be a Population II Cepheid given its\nlong period and its separation in magnitude from the RR Lyrae stars. We argue\nthat there does not appear to be a change in the period-luminosity relation\nslope between the BL Herculis and W Virginis stars, but that a change of slope\ndoes occur when the RV Tauri stars are added to the period-luminosity relation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 May 2003 19:35:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

In a small area of sky (190 square degrees),\nobserved much like the full survey will be, 269 white dwarfs and 56 hot\nsubdwarfs are identified spectroscopically where only 44 white dwarfs and 5 hot\nsubdwarfs were known previously. Most are ordinary DA (hydrogen atmosphere) and\nDB (helium) types. In addition, in the full survey to date, a number of WDs\nhave been found with uncommon spectral types. Among these are blue DQ stars\ndisplaying lines of atomic carbon; red DQ stars showing molecular bands of C_2\nwith a wide variety of strengths; DZ stars where Ca and occasionally Mg, Na,\nand/or Fe lines are detected; and magnetic WDs with a wide range of magnetic\nfield strengths in DA, DB, DQ, and (probably) DZ spectral types. Photometry\nalone allows identification of stars hotter than 12000 K, and the density of\nthese stars for 15<g<20 is found to be ~2.2 deg^{-2} at Galactic latitudes\n29-62 deg. Spectra are obtained for roughly half of these hot stars. The\nspectra show that, for 15<g<17, 40% of hot stars are WDs and the fraction of\nWDs rises to ~90% at g=20. The remainder are hot sdB and sdO stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 May 2003 22:05:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

From the study of\nthe relative intensities of the OII recombination lines of multiplet 1 in this\nand other nebulae it isfound that for electron densities smaller than about\n5000 cm-3 collisional redistribution is not complete, this effect has to be\ntaken into account to derive the O abundances for those cases in which not all\nthe lines of the multiplet are observed.

We emphasise generic aspects of such problems and parallels\nwith disordered, non-interacting systems of fermions, and discuss in particular\nthe relevance for bosonic excitations of symmetry classes known in the\nfermionic context. We also stress important differences between bosonic and\nfermionic problems. One of these follows from the fact that ground state\nstability of a system requires all bosonic excitation energy levels to be\npositive, while stability in systems of non-interacting fermions is ensured by\nthe exclusion principle, whatever the single-particle energies. As a\nconsequence, simple models of uncorrelated disorder are less useful for bosonic\nsystems than for fermionic ones, and it is generally important to study the\nexcitation spectrum in conjunction with the problem of constructing a\ndisorder-dependent ground state: we show how a mapping to an operator with\nchiral symmetry provides a useful tool for doing this. A second difference\ninvolves the distinction for bosonic systems between excitations which are\nGoldstone modes and those which are not. In the case of Goldstone modes we\nreview established results illustrating the fact that disorder decouples from\nexcitations in the low frequency limit, above a critical dimension $d_c$, which\nin different circumstances takes the values $d_c=2$ and $d_c=0$.

From\npractical point of view, the emphasis is on the ability of the developed models\nto provide the adequate input for the numerous portfolio and risk management\nprocedures used in the financial industry. This is crucial, since it has been\nlong argued that correlation matrices determined from financial series contain\na relatively large amount of noise and, in addition, most of the portfolio and\nrisk management techniques used in practice can be quite sensitive to the\ninputs. In this paper we introduce a model (simulation)-based approach which\ncan be used for a systematic investigation of the effect of the different\nsources of noise in financial correlations in the portfolio and risk management\ncontext. To illustrate the usefulness of this framework, we develop several toy\nmodels for the structure of correlations and, by considering the finiteness of\nthe time series as the only source of noise, we compare the performance of\nseveral correlation matrix estimators introduced in the academic literature and\nwhich have since gained also a wide practical use. Based on this experience, we\nbelieve that our simulation-based approach can also be useful for the\nsystematic investigation of several other problems of much interest in finance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 May 2003 15:49:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

One approach to estimating these\nparameters relies on a sequence of initial data slices that attempt to capture\nthe physics of the inspiral. Using calculations of the binding energy, several\nauthors have estimated the ISCO parameters using initial data constructed with\nvarious algorithms.

To take into account this generic possibility, it is necessary to\ndemand that \\emph{physical theories in a given coordinate system must be\nformulated entirely in terms of variables that an observer using that\ncoordinate system can access}. This principle is powerful enough to obtain the\nfollowing results: (a) The action principle of gravity must be of such a\nstructure that, in the semiclassical limit, the action of the unobserved\ndegrees of freedom reduces to a boundary contribution $A_{\\rm boundary}$\nobtained by integrating a four divergence.
