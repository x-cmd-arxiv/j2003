The disk is treated as a set of gravitating rings, with\nthe rings'/planets' time-evolution governed by the classical Laplace-Lagrange\nsolution for secular evolution but modified to account for the disk's finite\nthickness h. This system's Lagrange planetary equations yield a particular\nclass of spiral wave solutions, usually denoted as apsidal density waves and\nnodal bending waves. There are two varieties of apsidal waves:long waves and\nshort waves. Planets typically launch long density waves at the disk's nearer\nedge or else at a secular resonance in the disk, and these waves ultimately\nreflect downstream at a more distant disk edge or else at a Q-barrier in the\ndisk, whereupon they return as short density waves. Planets also launch nodal\nbending waves, and these have the property that they can stall in the disk,\nthat is, their group velocity plummets to zero upon approaching a disk region\ntoo thick to support the continued propagation of bending waves. The rings\nmodel is used to compute the secular evolution of a Kuiper Belt having a\nvariety of masses, and it is shown that the early massive Belt was very\nsusceptible to the propagation of low-amplitude apsidal and nodal waves\nlaunched by the giant planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 May 2003 16:38:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Utilizing our photometric redshift technique a volume\nlimited sample containing more than 2 million galaxies is constructed from the\nSDSS galaxy catalog. In the largest such analysis to date, we study the angular\nclustering as a function of luminosity and spectral type. Using Limber's\nequation we calculate the clustering length for the full data set as\nr0=5.77+/-0.10 Mpc/h. We find that r0 increases with luminosity by a factor of\n1.6 over the sampled luminosity range, in agreement with previous redshift\nsurveys.

In this work we study\nY-123 (YBCO) microbridges sputtered over SrTiO3 substrates. We measure their\nCVCs for different temperatures close to Tc, and with low applied magnetic\nfield, from 0 to 1 T. We compare the dependences of Jc and J*, and find that\nsome of the typical experimental results in this regime could be explained by\nonly considering the effect of the current self-field.

We\nalso study the influence of thermal effects, by using a simplified model to\ndescribe the thermal evolution of our samples.
