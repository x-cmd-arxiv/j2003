As the presupernova models, we adopt the latest ones by Woosley, Heger,\nand Weaver, and, further, models with both solar and zero metallicity are\ninvestigated. Since the $(1-2Y_e)$ profile of the new presupernova models,\nwhich is responsible for the RSF conversion, suddenly drops at the resonance\nregion, the completely adiabatic RSF conversion is not realized, even if\n$\\mu_\\nu B_0= (10^{-12}\\mu_B)(10^{10} G)$, where $B_0$ is the strength of the\nmagnetic field at the surface of the iron core. In particular for the model\nwith zero metallicity, the conversion is highly nonadiabatic in the high energy\nregion, reflecting the $(1-2Y_e)$ profile of the model. In calculating the\nflavor conversion, we find that the shock wave propagation, which changes\ndensity profiles drastically, is a much more severe problem than it is for the\npure Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) conversion case. This is because the\nRSF effect occurs at a far deeper region than the MSW effect. To avoid the\nuncertainty concerning the shock propagation, we restrict our discussion to 0.5\ns after the core bounce (and for more conservative discussion, 0.25 s), during\nwhich the shock wave is not expected to affect the RSF region. We also evaluate\nthe energy spectrum at the Super-Kamiokande detector for various models using\nthe calculated conversion probabilities, and find that it is very difficult to\nobtain useful information on the supernova metallicities and magnetic fields or\non the neutrino magnetic moment from the supernova neutrino observation.

The philosophy of the method discussed in the first part\nof this thesis is to use a symmetry of the decoherence mechanism to find robust\nencodings of the quantum information. Stability, control, and methods for using\ndecoherence-free information in a quantum computer are presented with a\nspecific emphasis on decoherence due to a collective coupling between the\nsystem and its environment. Universal quantum computation on such collective\ndecoherence decoherence-free encodings is demonstrated. Rigorous definitions of\ncontrol and the use of encoded universality in quantum computers are addressed.\nExplicit gate constructions for encoded universality on ion trap and exchange\nbased quantum computers are given. In the second part of the thesis we examine\nphysical systems with error correcting properties. We examine systems that can\nstore quantum information in their ground state such that decoherence processes\nare prohibited via energetics. We present the theory of supercoherent systems\nwhose ground states are quantum error detecting codes and describe a spin\nladder whose ground state has both the error detecting and correcting\nproperties.
