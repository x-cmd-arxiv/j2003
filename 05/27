Rotationally induced mixing\nduring the thermal pulses produces a layer (~2E-5M_sun) on top of the CO-core\nwhere large amounts of protons and C12 co-exist. We follow the abundance\nevolution in this layer, in particular that of the neutron source C13 and of\nthe neutron poison N14. In our AGB model mixing persists during the entire\ninterpulse phase due to the steep angular velocity gradient at the\ncore-envelope interface. We follow the neutron production during the interpulse\nphase, and find a resulting maximum neutron exposure of tau_max =0.04 mbarn^-1,\nwhich is too small to produce any significant s-process. In parametric models,\nwe then investigate the combined effects of diffusive overshooting from the\nconvective envelope and rotationally induced mixing. Models with overshoot and\nweaker interpulse mixing - as perhaps expected from more slowly rotating stars\n- yield larger neutron exposures. We conclude that the incorporation of\nrotationally induce mixing processes has important consequences for the\nproduction of heavy elements in AGB stars. Through a distribution of initial\nrotation rates it may lead to a natural spread in the neutron exposures\nobtained in AGB stars of a given mass - as appears to be required by\nobservations. Our results suggest that both processes, diffusive overshoot and\nrotational mixing, may be required to obtain a consistent description of the\ns-process in AGB stars which fulfils all observational constraints.

This is a\nfundamental problem in general, and of particular interest for Bayesian\nnetworks. Recently, Grunwald and Halpern have shown that commonly used updating\nstrategies fail in this case, except under very special assumptions. In this\npaper we propose a new method for updating probabilities with incomplete\nobservations. Our approach is deliberately conservative: we make no assumptions\nabout the so-called incompleteness mechanism that associates complete with\nincomplete observations. We model our ignorance about this mechanism by a\nvacuous lower prevision, a tool from the theory of imprecise probabilities, and\nwe use only coherence arguments to turn prior into posterior probabilities. In\ngeneral, this new approach to updating produces lower and upper posterior\nprobabilities and expectations, as well as partially determinate decisions.\nThis is a logical consequence of the existing ignorance about the\nincompleteness mechanism. We apply the new approach to the problem of\nclassification of new evidence in probabilistic expert systems, where it leads\nto a new, so-called conservative updating rule. In the special case of Bayesian\nnetworks constructed using expert knowledge, we provide an exact algorithm for\nclassification based on our updating rule, which has linear-time complexity for\na class of networks wider than polytrees. This result is then extended to the\nmore general framework of credal networks, where computations are often much\nharder than with Bayesian nets. Using an example, we show that our rule appears\nto provide a solid basis for reliable updating with incomplete observations,\nwhen no strong assumptions about the incompleteness mechanism are justified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 May 2003 11:05:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 May 2004 15:03:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
