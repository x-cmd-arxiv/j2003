Their distances are now\nroutinely estimated through two techniques: the expanding photosphere method\n(EPM), a primary distance-determining method, and the recently developed\nstandard-candle method (SCM), a promising secondary technique. Using Cycle 10\nHST observations, we identify 41 Cepheid variable stars in NGC 1637, the host\ngalaxy of the most thoroughly studied SN II-P to date, SN 1999em. Remarkably,\nthe Cepheid distance that we derive to NGC 1637, D = 11.7 +/- 1.0 Mpc, is\nnearly 50% larger than earlier EPM distance estimates to SN 1999em.

The emission features in the FUSE\n920-1180 A wavelength range allow for a critical probe of the hot plasma over\nthree decades in temperature. Using the flux ratio CIII 1176/977 as\ndiagnostics, we investigate the dependence of the electron pressure of the\ntransition region as a function of the rotation period, age and magnetic\nactivity. The results from these solar proxies indicate that the electron\npressure of the stellar ~10^5-K plasma decreases by a factor of about 70\nbetween the young, fast-rotating magnetically active star and the old,\nslow-rotating inactive star. Also, the observations indicate that the average\nsurface fluxes of emission features strongly decrease with increasing stellar\nage and longer rotation period. The emission flux evolution with age or\nrotation period is well fitted by power laws, which become steeper from cooler\nchromospheric (10^4 K) to hotter coronal (10^7 K) plasma. The relationship for\nthe integrated (920-1180 A) FUSE flux indicates that the solar far-ultraviolet\nemissions were about twice the present value 2.5 Gyr ago and about 4 times the\npresent value 3.5 Gyr ago.

We show that electron-electron interactions\ndescribed by the Hubbard Hamiltonian lead to strong dephasing: the transmission\nprobability at flux $\\Phi=\\pi$ is high even at small interaction strength. In\naddition to inelastic scattering, we identify two energy conserving mechanisms\nof dephasing: symmetry-changing and spin-flip scattering. The many-electron\nstate on the ring determines which of these mechanisms will be at play:\ntransmitted current can occur either in elastic or inelastic channels, with or\nwithout changing the spin of the scattering electron.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 May 2003 07:15:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

This behavior is observed for four planes with different\nbump sizes (given by the size of the beads glued on the plane) from 200 microns\nto 2 mm. The relative roughness corresponding to the maximum of the friction\ncan be predicted with a geometrical model of stability of one single bead on\nthe plane. The main parameters are the size of the bumps and the size of the\nflowing beads. In order to obtain a higher precision, the model also takes into\naccount of the spacing between the bumps of the rough plane. Experimental\nresults and model are in good agreement for all the planes we studied. Other\nparameters, like the sphericity of the beads, or irregularities in the\nthickness of the layer of glued particles, are shown to be of influence on the\nfriction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 May 2003 14:58:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

These methods seem particularly useful to the study of chaos since\nno analytical chaotic solution is currently available. Using the well-known\nLorenz equations as an example, it is demonstrated that numerically computed\nresults and their associated statistical properties are time-step dependent.\nThere are two reasons for this behavior. First, chaotic differential equations\nare unstable so that any small error is amplified exponentially near an\nunstable manifold. The more serious and lesser-known reason is that stable and\nunstable manifolds of singular points associated with differential equations\ncan form virtual separatrices. The existence of a virtual separatrix presents\nthe possibility of a computed trajectory actually jumping through it due to the\nfinite time-steps of discrete numerical methods. Such behavior violates the\nuniqueness theory of differential equations and amplifies the numerical errors\nexplosively. These reasons imply that, even if computed results are bounded,\ntheir independence on time-step should be established before accepting them as\nuseful numerical approximations to the true solution of the differential\nequations. However, due to these exponential and explosive amplifications of\nnumerical errors, no computed chaotic solutions of differential equations\nindependent of integration-time step have been found. Thus, reports of computed\nnon-periodic solutions of chaotic differential equations are simply\nconsequences of unstably amplified truncation errors, and are not approximate\nsolutions of the associated differential equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 May 2003 21:22:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2009 16:45:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 31 Dec 2009 18:57:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-31"}

In this\nframework, we here extend the polarimetric test of Pancharatnam's relative\nphase for spin$-{1/2}$ proposed by Wagh and Rakhecha [Phys. Lett. A {\\bf 197},\n112 (1995)] to spin $j\\geq 1$ undergoing noncyclic SO(3) evolution. We\ndemonstrate that the output intensity for higher spin values is a polynomial\nfunction of the corresponding spin$-{1/2}$ intensity. We further propose a\ngeneral method to extract the noncyclic SO(3) phase and visibility by rigid\ntranslation of two $\\pi /2$ spin flippers. Polarimetry on higher spin states\nmay in practice be done with spin polarized atomic beams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 May 2003 12:10:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Oct 2003 09:56:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

It is shown that histories of local number, momentum and\nenergy density are approximately decoherent, when coarse-grained over\nsufficiently large volumes. Decoherence arises directly from the proximity of\nthese variables to exactly conserved quantities (which are exactly decoherent),\nand not from environmentally-induced decoherence.
