We\nidentify the real and imaginary parts of the potential, which we call partner\nsymmetries, with the translational and dilatational symmetry characteristics\nrespectively. Then we choose the dilatational symmetry characteristic as the\nnew unknown replacing the K\\\"ahler potential which directly leads to a Legendre\ntransformation and to a set of linear equations satisfied by a single real\npotential. This enables us to construct non-invariant solutions of the Legendre\ntransform of the complex Monge-Amp\\`ere equation and obtain hyper-K\\\"ahler\nmetrics with anti-self-dual Riemann curvature 2-form that admit no Killing\nvectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 May 2003 12:29:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Jul 2003 08:27:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The double coset question addressed in this paper is the following:\nGiven closed subgroups $X$ and $P$, is the double coset collection $X\\backslash\nG/P$ finite or infinite? We limit ourselves to the case where $X$ is maximal\nrank and reductive and $P$ parabolic. This paper presents a criterion for\ninfiniteness which involves only dimensions of centralizers of semisimple\nelements. This result is then applied to finish the classification of those $X$\nwhich are spherical. Finally, excluding a case in $F_4$, we show that if\n$X\\backslash G/P$ is finite then $X$ is spherical or the Levi factor of $P$ is\nspherical. This implies that it is rare for $X\\backslash G/P$ to be finite.
