The following assumptions are adopted\nthroughout this paper: (1) The self-gravity of the dust layer is neglected. (2)\nOne fluid model is adopted, where the dust aggregates have the same velocity\nwith the gas due to strong coupling by the drag force. (3) The gas is\nincompressible.\n  The calculations with both the Coriolis and the tidal forces show that the\ntidal force has a stabilizing effect. The tidal force causes the radial shear\nin the disk. This radial shear changes the wave number of the mode which is at\nfirst unstable, and the mode is eventually stabilized. Thus the behavior of the\nmode is divided into two stages: (1) the first growth of the unstable mode\nwhich is similar to the results without the tidal force, and (2) the subsequent\nstabilization due to an increase of the wave number by the radial shear. If the\nmidplane dust/gas density ratio is smaller than 2, the stabilization occurs\nbefore the unstable mode grows largely. On the other hand, the mode grows\nfaster by one hundred orders of magnitude, if this ratio is larger than 20.\n  Because the critical density of the gravitational instability is a few\nhundreds times as large as the gas density, the hydrodynamic instability\ninvestigated in this paper grows largely before the onset of the gravitational\ninstability. It is expected that the hydrodynamic instability develops\nturbulence in the dust layer and the dust aggregates are stirred up to prevent\nfrom settling further. The formation of planetesimals through the gravitational\ninstabilities is difficult to occur as long as the dust/gas surface density\nratio is equal to that for the solar abundance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 May 2003 08:13:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

In the 2+n case, any\nfacet of the classical experience polytope is defined by a CHSH inequality\ninvolving only two pairs of the observables. In the 3+3 case, contrary to\nearlier results, the action of the symmetry group reduces the set of all Bell\ninequalities to just 3 orbits, only one of them being \"new\" (not known from the\n2+2 case). A detailed calculation for the singlet state of two qubits reveals\nthe configurations of a maximal violation for this class of inequalities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 May 2003 13:24:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
