Recent progress in the analysis of drifting\nsubpulses in pulsars has provided a strong support to this model by revealing a\nnumber of subbeams circulating around the magnetic axis in a manner compatible\nwith theoretical predictions. However, a more detailed analysis revealed that\nthe circulation speed in a pure vacuum gap is too high when compared with\nobservations. Moreover, some pulsars demonstrate significant time variations of\nthe drift rate, including a change of the apparent drift direction, which is\nobviously inconsistent with the EB drift scenario in a pure vacuum gap. We\nresolved these discrepancies by considering a partial flow of iron ions from\nthe positively charged polar cap, coexisting with the production of outflowing\nelectron-positron plasmas. By fitting the observationally deduced drift-rates\nto the theoretical values, we managed to estimate polar cap surface\ntemperatures in a number of pulsars.

When the applied field is\ntilted relative to the line defect, the physics is described by a nonhermitian\nLuttinger liquid of interacting quantum bosons in one spatial dimension with a\npoint defect. We analyze this problem using a combination of analytic and\nnumerical density matrix renormalization group methods, uncovering a delicate\ninterplay between enhancement of pinning due to Luttinger liquid effects and\ndepinning due to the tilted magnetic field. Interactions dramatically improve\nthe ability of a single columnar pin to suppress vortex tilt when the Luttinger\nliquid parameter g is less than or equal to one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 May 2003 20:02:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Jul 2003 15:59:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

Experimental confirmation of new features predicted here for the\nsuggested reaction would advance our understanding of hard nuclear reactions. A\nmain prediction, in contrast with low-energy observations, is that the $pp$\nbreakup cross section is not much smaller than the one for $pn$ break up.In\nsome models, the energy-dependent oscillations observed for $pp$ scattering are\npredicted to appear in the $\\gamma ^3{\\rm He} \\to p p + n$ reaction.
