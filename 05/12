Taking account of the\nspin-orbit interaction in the LDA scheme, we obtain the XMCD spectra in\nexcellent agreement with the recent experiment. We have analyzed the origin of\neach structure, and thus elucidated the mechanism of inducing the orbital\npolarization in the p symmetric states. We also discuss a simple sum rule\nconnecting the XMCD spectra with the orbital moment in the p symmetric states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 May 2003 04:48:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

This problem had been\ncarefully studied in a number of experiments that offer a wealth of data to\nchallenge the theory. We improve upon previous theoretical treatments in a\nnumber of ways. First, we offer a technical improvement of the discussion of\nthe instability towards the creation of a straight crack. This improvement\nconsists of employing Pad\\'e approximants to solve the relevant Weiner-Hopf\nfactorization problem that is associated with this transition. Next we improve\nthe discussion of the onset of oscillatory instability towards an undulating\ncrack. We offer a novel way of considering the problem as a sum of solutions of\na finite strip without a crack and an infinite medium with a crack. This allows\nus to present a closed form solution of the stress intensity factors in the\nvicinity of the oscillatory instability. Most importantly we develop a {\\em\ndynamical} description of the actual trajectory in the regime of oscillatory\ncrack. This theory is based on the dynamical law for crack propagation proposed\nby Hodgdon and Sethna. We show that this dynamical law results in a solution of\nthe actual track trajectory in post critical conditions; we can compute from\nfirst principles the critical value of the control parameters, and the\ncharacteristics of the solution like the wavelength of the oscillations. We\npresent detailed comparison with experimental measurements without any free\nparameter. The comparison appears quite excellent.

The new feature emerging in the\npresence of gravity is a concentration gradient which coupled with the nematic\nordering. For rodlike molecules this effect becomes noticeable at centrifugal\nacceleration g ~ 10^3--10^4 m/s^2, while for biological rodlike objects, such\nas tobacco mosaic virus, TMV, the effect is important even for normal\ngravitational acceleration conditions. Rods are concentrated near the bottom of\nthe vessel which sometimes leads to gravity induced nematic ordering. The\nconcentration range corresponding to phase separation increases with increasing\ng. In the region of phase separation the local rod concentration, as well as\nthe order parameter, follow a step function with height.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 May 2003 13:07:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The interest in using this method is that the nature\nand size or shape of the object, can be arbitrary. Even more, the presence of a\nsubstrate can be incorporated. To validate our theory, we present an analytical\nexpression of the force due to the light acting on a particle either in\npresence, or not, of a surface.

A generalized expression $\\tilde q_k(E)$ for the Fano parameter\nof the resonance state $k$ is derived that contains the interaction of the\nstate $k$ with neighboured states $l\\ne k$ via the continuum. It is energy\ndependent since the coupling coefficients between the state $k$ and the\ncontinuum show a resonance-like behaviour at the energies of the neighboured\nstates $l\\ne k$. Under certain conditions, the energy dependent $\\tilde q_k(E)$\nare equivalent to the generalized complex energy independent Fano parameters\nthat are introduced by Kobayashi et al. in analyzing experimental data.\nLong-lived states appear mostly isolated from one another in the cross section,\nalso when they are overlapped by short-lived resonance states.
