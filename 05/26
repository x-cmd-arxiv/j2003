More precisely we provide an explicit\nparameterization of arbitrary $n$-dimensional operators, operators that may be\nconsidered either as Hamiltonians, or density matrices for finite-level quantum\nsystems. It is shown that the spectral multiplicities are encoded in a flag\nunitary matrix obtained as an ordered product of special unitary matrices, each\none generated by a complex $n-k$-dimensional unit vector, $k=0,1,...,n-2$. As a\nbyproduct, an alternative and simple parameterization of Stiefel and Grassmann\nmanifolds is obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 May 2003 08:10:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The\nwave functions are always periodic. Two difficulties may be encountered: one is\nto solve the equation E=U(x), where E and U(x) are the total and potential\nenergies, respectively, and the other is to calculate the integral of the\nsquare root of U(x). If these calculations cannot be made analytically, it\nshould then be performed by numerical methods. To find the energy and the wave\nfunction of the ground state, there is no need to calculate this integral, it\nis sufficient to find the classical turning points, that is to solve the\nequation E=U(x).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 May 2003 13:59:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
