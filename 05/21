In\nthose models, the disk was assumed to be in steady-state, that is T_eff(r) is\nspecified completely by the mass M_WD and radius R_WD of the accreting white\ndwarf star and the mass transfer rate M_dot which is constant throughout the\ndisk. In these models, T_eff(r) is proportional to r^{-3/4} except as modified\nby a cutoff term near the white dwarf.\n  Actual disks may vary from the steady-state prescription for T_eff(r),\nhowever, e.g. owing to outburst cycles in dwarf novae M_dot not constant with\nradius) or irradiation (in which case T_eff in the outer disk is raised above\nT_steady). To show how the spectra of such disks might differ from the steady\ncase, we present a study of the ultraviolet (UV) spectra of models in which\npower-law temperature profiles T_eff(r) is proportional to r^{-gamma} with\ngamma < 3/4 are specified. Otherwise, the construction of the models is the\nsame as in the Wade & Hubeny grid, to allow comparison. We discuss both the UV\nspectral energy distributions and the appearance of the UV line spectra. We\nalso briefly discuss the eclipse light curves of the non-standard models.\nComparison of these models with UV observations of novalike variables suggests\nthat better agreement may be possible with such modified T_eff(r) profiles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 May 2003 23:10:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Nearly seventy sq. arcmin were covered over the\nclusters A370, A2218 and A2390. We present maps and photometry at 6.7 & 14.3\nmicrons, showing a total of 145 mid-IR sources and the associated source\ncounts. The 15 micron counts reach the faintest level yet recorded. All sources\nhave counterparts in the optical or near-IR. Models of the clusters were used\nto correct for the effects of lensing, which increases the sensitivity of the\nsurvey. Seven of fifteen SCUBA sources were detected at 15 microns. Five have\nredshift between 0.23 & 2.8, with a median of 0.9. The field sources were\ncounted to a lensing-corrected sensitivity of 30 microJy at 15 microns, and 14\nmicroJy at 7 microns. The counts, corrected for completeness, contamination by\ncluster sources and lensing, confirm and extend findings of an excess by a\nfactor of ten in the 15 micron population with respect to source models with no\nevolution.

The perturbations are\nclassified into the tensor, vector, and scalar-type modes according to their\ntensorial behaviour on the spherical section of the background metric, where\nthe last two modes correspond respectively to the axial- and the polar-mode in\nthe four-dimensional situation. We show that, for each mode of the\nperturbations, the spatial derivative part of the master equation is a\npositive, self-adjoint operator in the $L^2$-Hilbert space, hence that the\nmaster equation for each tensorial type of perturbations does not admit\nnormalisable negative-modes which would describe unstable solutions.\n  On the same Schwarzschild background, we also analyse the static perturbation\nof the scalar mode, and show that there exists no static perturbation which is\nregular everywhere outside the event horizon and well-behaved at spatial\ninfinity. This checks the uniqueness of the higher-dimensional spherically\nsymmetric, static, vacuum black hole, within the perturbation framework.\n  Our strategy for the stability problem is also applicable to the other\nhigher-dimensional maximally symmetric black holes with non-vanishing\ncosmological constant.

This paper treats both error-free comparison, and\ncomparison where errors in the result are allowed. Error-free comparison means\nthat we aim to obtain definite answers, which are known to be correct, as often\nas possible. In general, we will have to accept also inconclusive results,\ngiving no information. To obtain a definite answer that the states of the\nsystems are not identical is always possible, whereas, in the situation\nconsidered here, a definite answer that they are identical will not be\npossible. The optimal universal error-free comparison strategy is a projection\nonto the totally symmetric and the different non-symmetric subspaces, invariant\nunder permutations and unitary transformations. We also show how to construct\noptimal comparison strategies when allowing for some errors in the result,\nminimising either the error probability, or the average cost of making an\nerror. We point out that it is possible to realise universal error-free\ncomparison strategies using only linear elements and particle detectors, albeit\nwith less than ideal efficiency. Also minimum-error and minimum-cost strategies\nmay sometimes be realised in this way. This is of great significance for\npractical applications of quantum comparison.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 May 2003 10:07:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Sep 2003 16:56:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

Based on the notions of an information state, an\ninformation state space and a generalized observable, this general framework\ncovers the description of a wide range of experimental situations including\nthose where, with respect to a system, an experiment is perturbing. We prove\nthat, to any experiment upon a system, there corresponds a unique generalized\nobservable on a system initial information state space, which defines the\nprobability distribution of outcomes under this experiment. We specify the case\nwhere initial information on a system provides \"no knowledge\" for the\ndescription of an experiment. Incorporating in a uniform way the basic notions\nof conventional probability theory and the non-commutativity aspects and the\nbasic notions of quantum measurement theory, our framework clarifies the\nprinciple difference between Kolmogorov's model in probability theory and the\nstatistical model of quantum theory. Both models are included into our\nframework as particular cases. We show that the phenomenon of \"reduction\" of a\nsystem initial information state is inherent, in general, to any\nnon-destructive experiment and upon a system of any type. Based on our general\nframework, we introduce the probabilistic model for the description of\nnon-destructive experiments upon a quantum system and prove that positive\nbounded linear mappings on the Banach space of trace class operators, arising\nin the description of experiments upon a quantum system, are completely\npositive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 May 2003 15:23:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
