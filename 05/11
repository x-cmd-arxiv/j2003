This part of the spectrum is dominated by a series of\nstrong, wide emission features commonly called the Unidentified Infrared Bands.\nThe sampled area covers the inner Milky Way from l = -60 degr to +60 degr with\na ten-degree step in galactic longitude and nominal latitudes 0,+-1 degr. For\neach grid position the actual observed direction was selected from IRAS 100\nmicron maps to minimize contamination by point sources and molecular clouds.\nAll spectra were found to display the same spectral features. Band ratios are\nindependent of band strength and Galactic coordinates. A comparison of total\nobserved flux in band features and IRAS 100 micron emission, a tracer for large\ninterstellar dust grains, shows high correlation at large as well as small\n1-arcmin scales. This implies a strong connection between large dust grains and\nthe elusive band carriers; the evolutionary history and heating energy source\nof these populations must be strongly linked. The average mid-infrared spectrum\nof the Milky Way is found to be similar to the average spectrum of spiral\ngalaxy NGC 891 and the spectra of other spirals. The common spectrum can\ntherefore be used as a template for the 6-12 micron emission of late-type\nspiral galaxies. Finally, we show that interstellar extinction only weakly\ninfluences the observed features even at lambda = 10 microns, where the\nsilicate absorption feature is strongest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 May 2003 16:10:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The description of halos as nonsingular,\ntruncated isothermal spheres, a particular solution of the isothermal\nLane-Emden equation (suitably modified for Lambda nonzero), has proved to be a\nuseful approximation for the halos which form from realistic initial conditions\nin a CDM universe. The nonsingular TIS model reproduces many of the\nquantitative features of the N-body results for CDM halos, except in the very\ncenter, where CDM N-body halos show density profiles which vary as rho ~\nr^(-alpha), alpha>1, instead of a small flat core. Possible discrepancies\nbetween these cuspy halo predictions of the CDM N-body simulations and\nobservations of the inner mass profiles of dwarf and LSB disk galaxies based\nupon their rotation curves and of clusters based upon strong lensing\nmeasurements have led to a search for other diagnostics.
