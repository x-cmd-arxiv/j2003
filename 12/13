X-ray emission in NGC4438 is observed\nin a ~700 pc nuclear region, a 2.3 kpc spherical bulge, and a network of\nfilaments extending 4-10 kpc to the W and SW of the galaxy. The X-ray emission\nin all 3 regions is highly correlated to similar features observed in Halpha.\nSpectra of the filaments and bulge are well represented by a 0.4 keV MEKAL\nmodel with combined 0.3-2 keV intrinsic luminosity of 1.24x10^{40}erg/s,\nelectron densities ~ 0.02-0.04 cm^{-3}, cooling times of 400-700 Myr and X-ray\ngas mass <~ 3.7x10^8 Msolar. In the nuclear region of NGC4438 X-ray emission is\nseen from the nucleus and from two outflow bubbles extending 360(730) pc to the\nNW(SE) of the nucleus. The spectrum of the NW outflow bubble plus nucleus is\nwell fitted by an absorbed (n_H=1.9x10^{21} cm^{-2}) 0.58 keV MEKAL plasma\nmodel plus a heavily absorbed (n_H = 2.9 x10^{22} cm^{-2}) Gamma = 2, power law\ncomponent.

This makes it possible to detect\nprecursors undetectable by direct analysis. Possible mechanisms underlying RDP\nare outlined. RDP is described with a concrete example: we consider as\nshort-term precursors the newly introduced chains of earthquakes reflecting the\nrise of an earthquake correlation range; and detect (retrospectively) such\nchains a few months before two prominent Californian earthquakes - Landers,\n1992, M = 7.6, and Hector Mine, 1999, M = 7.3, with one false alarm.
