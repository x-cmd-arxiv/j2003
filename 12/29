Monitoring of Q2237+0305 in July-October 2000, made at nearly daily\nbasis, did not reveal rapid (night-to-night and intranight) variations of\nbrightness of the components during this time period. Rather slow changes of\nmagnitudes of the components were observed, such as 0.08 mag fading of B and C\ncomponents and 0.05 mag brightening of D in R band during July 23 - October 7,\n2000. By good luck three nights in 1999 were almost at the time of the strong\nbrightness peak of image C, and approximately in the middle of the ascending\nslope of the image A brightness peak. The C component was the most blue one in\nthe system in 1998 and 1999, having changed its (V-I) color from 0.56 mag to\n0.12 mag since August 1997, while its brightness increased almost 1.2 mag\nduring this time period.

A correlation between the color variations and variations of\nmagnitudes of the components is demonstrated to be significant and reaches\n0.75, with a regression line slope of 0.33. A color (V-I) vrs color (V-R) plot\nshows the components settled in a cluster, stretched along a line with a slope\nof 1.31. Both slopes are noticeably smaller than those expected if a standard\ngalactic interstellar reddening law were responsible for the differences\nbetween the colors of images and their variations over time. We attribute the\nbrightness and color changes to microlensing of the quasar's structure, which\nwe conclude is more compact at shorter wavelengths, as predicted by most quasar\nmodels featuring an energizing central source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Dec 2003 11:46:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

A key feature found by HETE-2 is\nthat the density of bursts is roughly constant per logarithmic interval in\nburst fluence S_E and observed spectral peak energy Ep_obs, and in\nisotropic-equivalent energy Eiso and rest frame spectral peak energy Epeak. In\nthis paper, we explore a unified jet model of all three kinds of bursts, using\npopulation synthesis simulations of the bursts and detailed modeling of the\ninstruments that detect them. We show that both a variable jet opening-angle\nmodel in which the emissivity is a constant independent of the angle relative\nto the jet axis and a universal jet model in which the emissivity is a\npower-law function of the angle relative to the jet axis can explain the\nobserved properties of GRBs reasonably well. However, if one tries to account\nfor the properties of all three kinds of bursts in a unified picture, the extra\ndegree of freedom available in the variable jet opening-angle model enables it\nto explain the observations reasonably well while the power-law universal jet\nmodel cannot. The variable jet opening-angle model of XRFs, X-ray-rich GRBs,\nand GRBs implies that the energy Egamma radiated in gamma rays is ~ 100 times\nless than has been thought, and that most GRBs have very small jet opening\nangles (~ half a degree).

In the interaction-term projection, the Stratonovich-Hubbard\ntransformation which hybridizes up and down spin electrons is introduced. By\nusing this method, the phase diagram of the two-dimensional Hubbard model with\nnext-nearest-neighbor transfer is accurately determined by treating the\nfilling-control (FC) and bandwidth-control (BC) Mott transitions on the same\nground. A V-shaped Mott insulating phase is obtained in the plane of the\nchemical potential and the Coulomb interaction, where the transitions at the\ncorner (BC) and the edges (FC) show contrasted characters with large critical\nfluctuations near the edges coexisting with the first-order transition at the\ncorner.

Classification of excited $\\bar q q$ mesons\naccording to the representations of chiral $U(2)_L \\times U(2)_R$ group is\nperformed.
