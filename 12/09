We include a\nphysically-motivated star formation recipe and consider the effects of\nfeedback. Our results indicate that star formation in the severe environment of\ndwarf galaxies is a difficult and inefficient process. For intermediate mass\nsystems, such as the dSphs around the Galaxy, star formation can proceed with\nin early cosmic epochs despite the intense background UV flux. Triggering\nprocesses such as merger events, collisions, and tidal disturbance can lead to\ndensity enhancements, reducing the recombination timescale, allowing gas to\ncool and star formation to proceed.

This allows to derive effective Hamiltonians\nthat contain the qualitative features of the spectrum, i.e. crossings and\navoided crossings, as a function of the coupling constant. At a second stage\nthe precision of the spectrum can be improved quantitatively by standard\nperturbative methods like contact transformations.

Employing a recently developed method of constructing\nthe Hilbert space and observables for Klein-Gordon fields, we then obtain the\nprobability current density ${\\cal J}_a^\\mu$ for the localization of a\nKlein-Gordon field in space. We show that in the nonrelativistic limit both\n$J_a^\\mu$ and ${\\cal J}_a^\\mu$ tend to the probability current density for the\nlocalization of a nonrelativistic free particle in space, but that unlike\n$J_a^\\mu$ the current density ${\\cal J}_a^\\mu$ is neither covariant nor\nconserved. Because the total probability may be obtained by integrating either\nof these two current densities over the whole space, the conservation of the\ntotal probability may be viewed as a consequence of the local conservation of\n$J_a^\\mu$. The latter is a manifestation of a previously unnoticed global gauge\nsymmetry of the Klein-Gordon fields. The corresponding gauge group is U(1) if\nthe parameter $a$ is rational. It is the multiplicative group of positive real\nnumbers if $a$ is irrational. We also discuss an extension of our results to\nKlein-Gordon fields minimally coupled to an electromagnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Dec 2003 12:22:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
