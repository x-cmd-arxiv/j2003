A\nlongstanding puzzle has been the absence of the Zeeman $\\pi $ components and\nthe high circular polarization in the observed spectra of these masers. We\nfirst argue that the elongation of eddies along the field that has recently\nbeen recognized in MHD turbulence will enhance the optical depth parallel to\nthe magnetic field in comparison with that perpendicular to the magnetic field.\nWe then simulate maser emission with a numerical model of MHD turbulence to\ndemonstrate quantitatively how the intensities of the linearly polarized $\\pi $\ncomponents are suppressed and the intensities of the nearly circularly\npolarized $\\sigma $ components are enhanced.

Elementary geometrical reasoning shows that\na model's largest dimension determines the rough value ell_min at which the CMB\npower spectrum ell(ell + 1)C_ell/(2pi) effectively begins; for cosmologically\nrelevant models, ell_min < 4. More surprisingly, elementary geometrical\nreasoning shows that further reduction of a model's smaller dimensions -- with\nits largest dimension held fixed -- serves to elevate modes in the neighborhood\nof ell_min relative to the high-ell portion of the spectrum, rather than\nsuppressing them as one might naively expect. Thus among the models whose\nlargest dimension is comparable to or less than the horizon diameter, the\nlow-order C_ell tend to be relatively weak in well-proportioned spaces (spaces\nwhose dimensions are approximately equal in all directions) but relatively\nstrong in oddly-proportioned spaces (spaces that are significantly longer in\nsome directions and shorter in others).

The problem is that consistency\nwith long distance experiments requires the graviton mass to be very small.\nSuch a small graviton mass however implies an ultraviolet cutoff for the theory\nat length scales far larger than the millimeter scale at which gravity has\nalready been measured. In this paper we attempt to construct a model which\navoids this problem. We consider a brane world setup in warped AdS spacetime\nand we investigate the consequences of writing a mass term for the graviton on\na the infrared brane where the local cutoff is of order a large (galactic)\ndistance scale. The advantage of this setup is that the low cutoff for physics\non the infrared brane does not significantly affect the predictivity of the\ntheory for observers localized on the ultraviolet brane. For such observers the\npredictions of this theory agree with general relativity at distances smaller\nthan the infrared scale but go over to those of a theory of massive gravity at\nlonger distances. A careful analysis of the graviton two-point function,\nhowever, reveals the presence of a ghost in the low energy spectrum. A mode\ndecomposition of the higher dimensional theory reveals that the ghost\ncorresponds to the radion field. We also investigate the theory with a brane\nlocalized mass for the graviton on the ultraviolet brane, and show that the\nphysics of this case is similar to that of a conventional four dimensional\ntheory with a massive graviton, but with one important difference: when the\ninfrared brane decouples and the would-be massive graviton gets heavier than\nthe regular Kaluza--Klein modes, it becomes unstable and it has a finite width\nto decay off the brane into the continuum of Kaluza-Klein states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Dec 2003 20:41:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2005 09:42:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Our main result is to\nreconciliate the EOLE dataset with recent studies supporting a k^{-5/3} energy\nspectrum in the range 100-1000 km. Our results also show exponential separation\nat smaller scale, with characteristic time of order 1 day, and agree with the\nstandard diffusion of about 10^7 m^2/s at large scales. A still open question\nis the origin of a k^{-5/3} spectrum in the mesoscale range, between 100 and\n1000 km.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Dec 2003 16:46:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
