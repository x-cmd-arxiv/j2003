The galaxies span a range in metallicity, luminosity,\nand environment, enabling the investigation of non--radiative ionization\nprocesses in a variety of galactic conditions.

The circuit consists of a kinase and\nphosphatase acting on multiple sites of a substrate that, contingent on its\nmodification state, catalyzes its own phosphorylation and, in a symmetric\nscenario, dephosphorylation. The symmetric case is viewed as a cartoon of\nconflicting feedback that could result from antagonistic pathways impinging on\nthe state of a shared component.\n  Results: Multisite phosphorylation is sufficient for bistable behavior under\nfeedback even when catalysis is linear in substrate concentration, which is the\ncase we consider. We compute the phase diagram, fluctuation spectrum and\nlarge-deviation properties related to switch memory within a statistical\nmechanics framework. Bistability occurs as either a first-order or second-order\nnon-equilibrium phase transition, depending on the network symmetries and the\nratio of phosphatase to kinase numbers. In the second-order case, the circuit\nnever leaves the bistable regime upon increasing the number of substrate\nmolecules at constant kinase to phosphatase ratio.\n  Conclusions: The number of substrate molecules is a key parameter controlling\nboth the onset of the bistable regime, fluctuation intensity, and the residence\ntime in a switched state. The relevance of the concept of memory depends on the\ndegree of switch symmetry, as memory presupposes information to be remembered,\nwhich is highest for equal residence times in the switched states.\n  Reviewers: This article was reviewed by Artem Novozhilov (nominated by Eugene\nKoonin), Sergei Maslov, and Ned Wingreen.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Dec 2003 23:23:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2005 12:54:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2007 22:16:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-10-02"}

Here I argue that the Everettian can have\neverything she needs from `probability' without recourse to indeterminism,\nignorance, primitive identity over time or subjective uncertainty: all she\nneeds is a particular *rationality principle*.\n  The decision-theoretic approach recently developed by Deutsch and Wallace\nclaims to provide just such a principle. But, according to Wallace, decision\ntheory is itself applicable only if the correct attitude to a future Everettian\nmeasurement outcome is subjective uncertainty. I argue that subjective\nuncertainty is not to be had, but I offer an alternative interpretation that\nenables the Everettian to live without uncertainty: we can justify Everettian\ndecision theory on the basis that an Everettian should *care about* all her\nfuture branches. The probabilities appearing in the decision-theoretic\nrepresentation theorem can then be interpreted as the degrees to which the\nrational agent cares about each future branch. This reinterpretation, however,\nreduces the intuitive plausibility of one of the Deutsch-Wallace axioms\n(Measurement Neutrality).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Dec 2003 23:15:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 May 2004 00:18:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In\nthe interrupted Oscillating Cantilever-driven Adiabatic Reversal (iOSCAR)\nmethod, small ensembles of electron spins are manipulated by an external radio\nfrequency (RF) magnetic field to produce small periodic deviations in the\nresonant frequency of the cantilever. These deviations can be detected by\nfrequency demodulation, followed by conventional amplitude or energy detection.\nIn this paper, we develop optimal detectors for several signal models that have\nbeen hypothesized for measurements induced by iOSCAR spin manipulation.
