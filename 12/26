Statistical\nproperties of our super-Alfvenic model without gravity agree with previous\nsimilar studies. Including self-gravity, our models give the following results.\nThey are consistent with the turbulent fragmentation prediction of the core\nmass distribution of Padoan & Nordlund. They also confirm that local\ngravitational collapse is not prevented by magnetohydrodynamic waves driven by\nturbulent flows, even when the turbulent Jeans mass exceeds the mass in the\nsimulation volume. Comparison of results between 256^3 and 512^3 zone\nsimulations reveals convergence in the collapse rate. Analysis of\nself-gravitating cores formed in the simulation shows that: (1) All cores\nformed are magnetically supercritical by at least an order of magnitude. (2) A\npower law relation between central magnetic field strength and density B_c\npropto rho_c^{1/2} is observed despite the cores being strongly supercritical.\n(3) Specific angular momentum j propto R^{3/2} for cores with radius R.

Assume that we have a global flow. Then we can exhibit a a\nlimit for the global behavior of the flow. In particular, we show the following\nresults. 1). Let $\\mathbf{M}$ be a compact locally symmetric space. If the\ncurve shortening flow exists for infinite time, and $$\n\\lim_{t\\to\\infty}L(\\gamma_{t})>0, $$ then for every $n>0$, $$ \\lim_{t\\to\n\\infty}\\sup(|\\frac{D^{n}T}{\\partial s^{n}}|)=0. $$ In particular, the limiting\ncurve exists and is a closed geodesic in $\\mathbf{M}$. 2).
