They are\nconsidered as the low-frequency normal modes in a disc of orbits precessing at\ndifferent angular speeds. Such a concept is an adequate alternative to the\ncommonly used approach of treating the disc as a set of individual stars\nrotating at near-circular orbits around the centre. The problem of determining\nthe normal modes is reduced to a simple integral equation in the form of the\nclassical eigen-value problem, where the eigen-value is directly equal to the\npattern speed of the mode, $\\Omega_p$. An examination of the general properties\nof the basic integral equation shows that two types of solutions exist,\nbar-like and spiral. The numerical solutions of both types are obtained. The\ncharacteristic pattern speeds are of the order of the mean orbit precession\nspeed, although for the bar-modes $\\Omega_p$ can markedly exceed the maximum\nprecessing speed of orbits. It is shown that the bar-mode grows due to the\nimmediate action of its gravitational field on the stars at the resonance\nregions. As for the spiral mode, its excitation is probably due to the inner\nLindblad resonance that can promote mode growth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Dec 2003 19:54:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

These solutions describe spacetimes with non-trivial\ntopology that are asymptotically dS, AdS or flat. For a negative cosmological\nconstant these solutions are NUT charged generalizations of the topological\nblack hole solutions in higher dimensions. We also point out the existence of\nsuch NUT charged spacetimes in odd dimensions and we explicitly construct such\nspaces in 5 and 7 dimensions. The existence of such spacetimes with non-trivial\ntopology is closely related to the existence of the cosmological constant.\nFinally, we discuss the global structure of such solutions and possible\napplications in string theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Dec 2003 05:04:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Jan 2004 19:27:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
