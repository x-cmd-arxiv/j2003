As representative examples models with initial masses of\n4Msun and 5Msun with a metallicity of Z=0.0001 ([Fe/H] ~ -2.3) are discussed.\nThe 1D stellar structure and evolution model includes time- and depth dependent\novershooting motivated by hydrodynamical simulations, as well as a full nuclear\nnetwork and time-dependent mixing. Particular attention is given to high time\nand space resolution to avoid numerical artefacts related to third dredge-up\nand hot-bottom burning predictions. The model calculations predict very\nefficient third dredge-up which mixes the envelope with the entire intershell\nlayer or a large fraction thereof, and in some cases penetrates into the C/O\ncore below the He-shell. In all cases primary oxygen is mixed into the\nenvelope. The models predict efficient envelope burning during the interpulse\nphase. Depending on the envelope burning temperature, oxygen is destroyed to\nvarying degrees. The combined effect of dredge-up and envelope burning does not\nlead to any significant oxygen depletion in any of the cases considered in this\nstudy. The large dredge-up efficiency in our model is closely related to the\nparticular properties of the H-shell during the dredge-up phase in\nlow-metallicity very metal poor stars, which is followed here over many thermal\npulses. During the dredge-up phase, the temperature just below the convective\nboundary is large enough for protons to burn vigorously when they are brought\ninto the C-rich environment below the convection boundary by the time- and\ndepth dependent overshooting. H-burning luminosities of 10^5 to ~2* 10^6L_sun\nare generated. [...]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Dec 2003 18:23:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

What is the origin of this quasi-periodicity? What is the\nnature of the global events that define the boundaries of the geological time\nscale? I propose that a single mechanism is responsible for all three types of\nsuch events: mass extinctions, geomagnetic polarity reversals, and sea-level\nfluctuations. The mechanism is fast, and involves a significant energy release.\nThe mechanism is unlikely to have astronomical causes, both because of the\nenergies involved, and because it acts quasi-periodically. It must then be\nsought within the Earth itself. And it must be capable of reversing the Earth's\nmagnetic field. The last requirement makes it incompatible with the consensus\nmodel of the origin of the geomagnetic field - the hydromagnetic dynamo\noperating in the Earth's fluid core. In the second part of the paper, I show\nthat a vast amount of seemingly unconnected geophysical and geological data can\nbe understood in a unified way if the source of the Earth's main magnetic field\nis a ~200-km-thick lithosphere, repeatedly magnetized as a result of\nmethane-driven oceanic eruptions, which produce ocean flow capable of dynamo\naction. The eruptions are driven by the interplay of buoyancy forces and\nexsolution of dissolved gas, which accumulates in the oceanic water masses\nprone to stagnation and anoxia. Polarity reversals, mass extinctions, and\nsequence boundaries are consequences of these eruptions. Unlike the consensus\nmodel of geomagnetism, this scenario is consistent with the paleomagnetic data\nshowing that \"directional changes during a [geomagnetic polarity] reversal can\nbe astonishingly fast, possibly occurring as a nearly instantaneous jump from\none inclined dipolar state to another in the opposite hemisphere\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Dec 2003 19:36:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2018 15:03:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-04"}

This conservation law enables us to define a local\nmass in the bulk. We show that there is a unique generalization of the dark\nradiation on the brane, which is given by the local mass. We find there also\nexists a conserved current associated with the Weyl tensor, and the\ncorresponding local charge, which we call the Weyl charge, is given by the sum\nof the local mass and a certain linear combination of the components of the\nbulk energy-momentum tensor. This expression of the Weyl charge relates the\nlocal mass with the projected Weyl tensor, $E_{\\mu\\nu}$, which plays a central\nrole in the geometrical formalism of the RS braneworld. On the brane, in\nparticular, this gives a decomposition of the projected Weyl tensor into the\nlocal mass and the bulk energy-momentum tensor.

In this note we further develop this approach, and propose three\nnatural conjectures which imply the three parts of the CDSW conjecture. In a\nsense, these conjectures explain why the CDSW conjecture should be true. We\nshow that our conjectures hold for classical Lie algebras and for G_2; this, in\nparticular, gives a purely algebraic proof of the CDSW conjecture for SO(N)\n(the original proof, due to Witten, uses the theory of instantons).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Dec 2003 22:02:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
