Based on the self-similarity\nrelations of dusty SEDs derived by Ivezic & Elitzur (1997), we expect an\napproximate invariance of the IR SED for models with different grain sizes.\nApproximate invariance follows from the fact that differently sized grains have\nsimilar optical properties at long wavelengths where the dust reprocesses the\nstarlight. In this paper, we discuss what are the physical requirements on the\nmodel parameters to maintain the approximate invariance of the IR SED. Single\ngrain size models are studied for a wide range of grain sizes in three optical\ndepth regimes. In this study, we find limits for the cases where the IR SED is\nand is not capable of conveying information about grain sizes, and to what\nextent it does so. We find that approximate invariance occurs for a much larger\nrange of grain sizes than previously believed, and, when approximate invariance\nholds, the SED is controlled mainly by one parameter, the reprocessing optical\ndepth, a quantity that measures the fraction of starlight that is absorbed by\nthe dust grains. Models with a grain size distribution are studied as well. For\nthese models, we find that, in many instances, the concept of approximate\ninvariance may be extended from the IR SED to all wavelengths. This means that,\nfor a wide range of optical depths, models with different grain size\ndistributions will produce very similar SEDs and, hence, the reprocessing\noptical depth is the only quantity that can be unambiguously obtained from the\nSED.

The one-sigma error includes noise,\ncosmic variance, systematics and the redshift uncertainty of the source\ngalaxies.

The ghost condensate is a new kind of\nfluid that can fill the universe, which has the same equation of state, \\rho =\n-p, as a cosmological constant, and can hence drive de Sitter expansion of the\nuniverse. However, unlike a cosmological constant, it is a physical fluid with\na physical scalar excitation, which can be described by a systematic effective\nfield theory at low energies. The excitation has an unusual low-energy\ndispersion relation \\omega^2 \\sim k^4 / M^2. If coupled to matter directly, it\ngives rise to small Lorentz-violating effects and a new long-range 1/r^2 spin\ndependent force. In the ghost condensate, the energy that gravitates is not the\nsame as the particle physics energy, leading to the possibility of both sources\nthat can gravitate and antigravitate. The Newtonian potential is modified with\nan oscillatory behavior starting at the distance scale M_{Pl}/M^2 and the time\nscale M_{Pl}^2/M^3.

When comparing the class\nof canalizing functions to other classes of functions with respect to their\nevolutionary plausibility as emergent control rules in genetic regulatory\nsystems, it is informative to know the number of canalizing functions with a\ngiven number of input variables. This is also important in the context of using\nthe class of canalizing functions as a constraint during the inference of\ngenetic networks from gene expression data. To this end, we derive an exact\nformula for the number of canalizing Boolean functions of n variables.

In addition, we consider\nthe number and probability of Boolean functions that are canalizing for exactly\nk variables.

Not so with the eigenvalues ($\\pm 1$) of the parity\noperator. The effect of such a measurement on a mixture of even and odd states\nof the harmonic oscillator is akin to separating at a single stroke a pair of\nshuffled card decks: the result is a set of definite parity, though otherwise\nmixed. The Wigner function should be a sensitive probe for this phenomenon, for\nit can be interpreted as the expectation value of the parity operator. We here\nderive the general form of Wigner functions $W_{\\pm}$, resulting from an ideal\nparity measurement on $W(\\x)$. Even if $W(\\x)$ resembles a classical\ndistribution, $W_{\\pm}$ displays a quantum spike, which is positive for $W_+$\nand negative for $W_-$. However we conjecture that $W_+$ always has negative\nvalues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Dec 2003 20:55:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
