The observed\nproduction of magnesium in the absence of oxygen synthesis appears to be\ninconsistent with current predictions for supernova nucleosynthesis yields; we\nsuggest that this may be connected to the Wolf-Rayet phenomenon, which occurs\nin the pertinent metallicity range. The trend of [Ti/Fe] shows an enhancement\nrelative to the solar neighborhood of $\\sim$0.3 dex, but declines somewhat by\nsolar metallicity; thus, the Ti trend is less extreme than found by McWilliam &\nRich (1994, MR94).

At this value of \\eta, the Li7 abundance is predicted to be\nsignificantly higher than that observed in low metallicity halo dwarf stars.\nAmong the possible resolutions to this discrepancy are 1) Li7 depletion in the\natmosphere of stars; 2) systematic errors originating from the choice of\nstellar parameters - most notably the surface temperature; and 3) systematic\nerrors in the nuclear cross sections used in the nucleosynthesis calculations.\nHere, we explore the last possibility, and focus on possible systematic errors\nin the He3(\\alpha,\\gamma)Be7 reaction, which is the only important Li7\nproduction channel in BBN. The absolute value of the cross section for this key\nreaction is known relatively poorly both experimentally and theoretically. The\nagreement between the standard solar model and solar neutrino data thus\nprovides additional constraints on variations in the cross section (S_{34}).\nUsing the standard solar model of Bahcall, and recent solar neutrino data, we\ncan exclude systematic S_{34} variations of the magnitude needed to resolve the\nBBN Li7 problem at > 95% CL.

Initial J/psi production and destruction by\nincoming nucleons are described by the Glauber model. J/psi-charm equilibration\nin the gluon plasma is described by the kinetic formation model. We explore the\npossibility of J/psi suppression suggested by the recent PHENIX data. We show\nthat the J/psi yield monotonically decreases with increasing centrality in the\nkinetic formation model when the charm mass is smaller than a critical mass.\nThe final J/psi yield is between the value after the Glauber suppression and\nthe dynamical equilibrium value. This underscores the importance of both J/psi\nproduction from d-Au collisions, which is essential in determining the Glauber\nsuppression, and high statistics Au-Au data, which can further constrain final\nstate J/psi-charm equilibration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Dec 2003 15:40:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2004 19:24:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
