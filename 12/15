We\nfind that this cluster dominates the galaxy emission longward of 3 \\mic, that\nit has a bolometric luminosity of $1.2~10^9 L_{\\odot}$ and a mass of $1.2~10^6\nM_{\\odot}$, giving $L/M\\approx10^3$. The cluster is obscured by 7 mag of\noptical extinction produced by about 1.5 10$^{5}$ $M_{\\odot}$ of dust. The dust\nproperties are peculiar with respect to the dust properties in the solar\nneighbourhood with a composition characterized by a lack of silicates and a\nflatter size distribution than the standard one, i.e. a bias toward larger\ngrains.

Using soft (rather than crisp) constraints, we develop a\nuniform formal notion for the two goals. They are no longer formalised as mere\nyes/no properties as in the existing literature, but gain an extra parameter,\nthe security level. For example, different messages can enjoy different levels\nof confidentiality, or a principal can achieve different levels of\nauthentication with different principals.\n  The goals are formalised within a general framework for protocol analysis\nthat is amenable to mechanisation by model checking. Following the application\nof the framework to analysing the asymmetric Needham-Schroeder protocol, we\nhave recently discovered a new attack on that protocol as a form of retaliation\nby principals who have been attacked previously. Having commented on that\nattack, we then demonstrate the framework on a bigger, largely deployed\nprotocol consisting of three phases, Kerberos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Dec 2003 21:17:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-27"}

We write W(F) for the\nWitt ring of F, consisting of the isomorphism classes of all anisotropic\nquadratic forms over F. For any element x of W(F), dimension dim x is defined\nas the dimension of a quadratic form representing x. The elements of all even\ndimensions form an ideal denoted I(F). The filtration of the ring W(F) by the\npowers I(F)^n of this ideal plays a fundamental role in the algebraic theory of\nquadratic forms. The Milnor conjectures, recently proved by Voevodsky and\nOrlov-Vishik-Voevodsky, describe the successive quotients I(F)^n/I(F)^{n+1} of\nthis filtration, identifying them with Galois cohomology groups and with the\nMilnor K-groups modulo 2 of the field F. In the present article we give a\ncomplete answer to a different old-standing question concerning I(F)^n, asking\nabout the possible values of dim x for x in I(F)^n. More precisely, for any\npositive integer n, we prove that the set dim I^n of all dim x for all x in\nI(F)^n and all F consisists of 2^{n+1}-2^i, i=1,2,...,n+1 together with all\neven integers greater or equal to 2^{n+1}.

From our\ndynamical calculations we find that both models do not describe the maximum in\nthe $K^+/\\pi^+$ ratio at 20 - 30 AGeV in central Au+Au collisions found\nexperimentally, though the excitation functions of strange mesons are\nreproduced well in HSD and UrQMD. Furthermore, the transport calculations show\nthat the charmonium recreation by $D+\\bar{D} \\to J/\\Psi + meson$ reactions is\ncomparable to the dissociation by 'comoving' mesons at RHIC energies contrary\nto SPS energies. This leads to the final result that the total $J/\\Psi$\nsuppression as a function of centrality at RHIC should be less than the\nsuppression seen at SPS energies where the 'comover' dissociation is\nsubstantial and the backward channels play no role. Furthermore, our transport\ncalculations -- in comparison to experimental data on transverse momentum\nspectra from $pp$, d+Au and Au+Au reactions -- show that pre-hadronic effects\nare responsible for both the hardening of the hadron spectra for low transverse\nmomenta (Cronin effect) as well as the suppression of high $p_T$ hadrons. The\nmutual interactions of formed hadrons are found to be negligible in central\nAu+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV for $p_T \\geq$ 6 GeV/c and the\nsizeable suppression seen experimentally is attributed to a large extent to the\ninteractions of 'leading' pre-hadrons with the dense environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Dec 2003 11:52:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

Network motifs\nwere suggested to be elementary building blocks that carry out key functions in\nthe network. It is of interest to understand how network motifs combine to form\nlarger structures. To address this, we present a systematic approach to define\n'motif generalizations': families of motifs of different sizes that share a\ncommon architectural theme. To define motif generalizations, we first define\n'roles' in a subgraph according to structural equivalence. For example, the\nfeedforward loop triad, a motif in transcription, neuronal and some electronic\nnetworks, has three roles, an input node, an output node and an internal node.\nThe roles are used to define possible generalizations of the motif. The\nfeedforward loop can have three simple generalizations, based on replicating\neach of the three roles and their connections. We present algorithms for\nefficiently detecting motif generalizations. We find that the transcription\nnetworks of bacteria and yeast display only one of the three generalizations,\nthe multi-output feedforward generalization. In contrast, the neuronal network\nof \\emph{C. elegans} mainly displays the multi-input generalization.\nForward-logic electronic circuits display a multi-input, multi-output hybrid.\nThus, networks which share a common motif can have very different\ngeneralizations of that motif. Using mathematical modelling, we describe the\ninformation processing functions of the different motif generalizations in\ntranscription, neuronal and electronic networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Dec 2003 13:24:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2004 18:27:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 16 May 2004 13:53:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
