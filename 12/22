Our argument assumes that the reionization ended around z ~ 6 and that\nit was a relatively quick process, i.e., that there was a non-negligible\nfraction of neutral hydrogen in the Universe at somewhat earlier epochs.\nStarting from our earlier estimate of the luminosity function (LF) of galaxies\nat z ~ 6, we quantitatively show that the major sources of reionization are\nmost likely galaxies with L < L*. Our approach allows us to put stronger\nconstraints to the LF of galaxies at z ~ 6. To have the Universe completely\nionized at this redshift, the faint-end slope of the LF should be steeper than\n$\\alpha=-1.6$, which is the value measured at lower redshifts (z ~ 3), unless\neither the normalization (Phi*) of the LF or the clumping factor of the ionized\nhydrogen has been significantly underestimated.

On the other hand, the\nexistence of significant amounts of neutral hydrogen at slightly earlier\nepochs, e.g. z ~ 7, requires that the least luminous galaxies should not be\nfainter than another critical value (i.e., the LF should cut-off at this\npoint).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Dec 2003 01:42:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The\nmeasured masses for the primary and secondary, accurate to ~1%, are 1.01 Msun\nand 0.73 Msun, respectively; thus the primary is a definitive pre-main-sequence\nsolar analog, and the secondary is the lowest-mass star yet discovered among\npre-main-sequence eclipsing binary systems.

If true, this might indicate that\nclose, detached, double white dwarfs are able to survive the onset of mass\ntransfer caused by gravitational wave radiation and emerge as the\nsemi-detached, hydrogen-deficient stars known as the AM CVn stars. The\naccreting white dwarfs in such systems are large compared to the orbital\nseparations. This has two effects: first it makes it likely that the mass\ntransfer stream can hit the accretor directly, and second it causes a loss of\nangular momentum from the orbit which can destabilise the mass transfer unless\nthe angular momentum lost to the accretor can be transferred back to the orbit.\nThe effect of the destabilisation is to reduce the number of systems which\nsurvive mass transfer by as much as one hundred-fold. In this paper we analyse\nthis destabilisation and the stabilising effect of a dissipative torque between\nthe accretor and the binary orbit. We obtain analytic criteria for the\nstability of both disc-fed and direct impact accretion, and carry out numerical\nintegrations to assess the importance of secondary effects, the chief one being\nthat otherwise stable systems can exceed the Eddington accretion rate. We show\nthat to have any effect upon survival rates, the synchronising torque must act\non a timescale of order 1000 years or less. If synchronisation torques are this\nstrong, then they will play a significant role in the spin rates of white\ndwarfs in cataclysmic variable stars as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Dec 2003 11:59:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

In Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus thermus, and cyanobacteria, the\nfilaments can wrap into complex supercoiled structures as the cells grow. The\nstructures may be solenoids or plectonemes, with or without branches in the\nlatter case. Any microscopic theory of these morphological instabilities must\naddress the nature of pattern selection in the presence of growth, for growth\nrenders the problem nonautonomous and the bifurcations dynamic. To gain insight\ninto these phenomena, we formulate a general theory for growing elastic\nfilaments with bending and twisting resistance in a viscous medium, and study\nan illustrative model problem: a growing filament with preferred twist, closed\ninto a loop. Growth depletes the twist, inducing a twist strain. The closure of\nthe loop prevents the filament from unwinding back to the preferred twist;\ninstead, twist relaxation is accomplished by the formation of supercoils.\nGrowth also produces viscous stresses on the filament which even in the absence\nof twist produce buckling instabilities. Our linear stability analysis and\nnumerical studies reveal two dynamic regimes. For small intrinsic twist the\ninstability is akin to Euler buckling, leading to solenoidal structures, while\nfor large twist it is like the classic writhing of a twisted filament,\nproducing plectonemic windings. This model may apply to situations in which\nsupercoils form only, or more readily, when axial rotation of filaments is\nblocked. Applications to specific biological systems are proposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Dec 2003 21:31:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-26"}

By computing the evolution of quasi-equilibrium neutron star binary\nconfigurations in the absence of gravitational radiation backreaction, we have\nconfirmed that these configurations can remain dynamically stable all the way\nto the development of a cusp.

Using this technique combined with fluorescence microscopy, we\nobserved that the length of lambda-DNA molecules was extended to about 1.6\ntimes their contour length (unextended length, 16.2 micrometers) by the combing\nmethod on hydrophobic polymethylmetacrylate (PMMA) coated surfaces. The effects\nof sodium and magnesium ions and pH of the DNA solution were investigated.\nInterestingly, we observed force-induced melting of single DNA molecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Dec 2003 07:42:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The vacuum fluctuations are modified by conductors and\ndielectrics, as in the Casimir effect, and hence, bodies in the vicinity of the\nbeams can influence the beam coherence. We calculate the quenching of\ninterference of two beams moving in vacuum parallel to a thick plate with\npermittivity $\\epsilon(\\omega)=\\epsilon_{0}+i 4\\pi\\sigma/\\omega$. In case of an\nideal conductor or dielectric $(|\\epsilon|=\\infty)$ the dephasing is suppressed\nwhen the beams are close to the surface of the plate, because the random\ntangential electric field $E_{t}$, responsible for dephasing, is zero at the\nsurface. The situation is changed dramatically when\n  $\\epsilon_{0}$ or $\\sigma$ are finite. In this case there exists a layer near\nthe surface, where the fluctuations of $E_{t}$ are strong due to evanescent\nnear fields. The thickness of this near - field layer is of the order of the\nwavelength in the dielectric or the skin depth in the conductor, corresponding\nto a frequency which is the inverse electron time of flight from the emitter to\nthe detector. When the beams are within this layer their dephasing is enhanced\nand for slow enough electrons can be even stronger than far from the surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Dec 2003 15:31:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}
