Various possible approaches for the training of the\nneural network are explored, including the deepest and most complete\nspectroscopic redshift catalog currently available (the Hubble Deep Field North\ndataset) and models of the spectral energy distribution of galaxies available\nin the literature. The MLP can be trained on observed data, theoretical data\nand mixed samples. The prediction of the method is tested on the spectroscopic\nsample in the HDF-S (44 galaxies). Over the entire redshift range, $0.1<z<3.5$,\nthe agreement between the photometric and spectroscopic redshifts in the HDF-S\nis good: the training on mixed data produces sigma_z(test) ~ 0.11, showing that\nmodel libraries together with observed data provide a sufficiently complete\ndescription of the galaxy population. The neural system capability is also\ntested in a low redshift regime, 0<z<0.4, using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\nData Release One (DR1) spectroscopic sample. The resulting accuracy on 88108\ngalaxies is sigma_z(test) ~ 0.022.

The cubic term leads to a relatively\nstrong first order transition, in contrast with the very weak first order\ntransitions in metallic type I superconductors. The strength of the first order\ntransition decreases with increasing baryon density. In addition gluonic\nfluctuations lower the critical temperature of the first order transition.

Our analysis shows that the\nstability number of every graph G can be decomposed in the sum of the stability\nnumber of a subgraph containing a perfect 2-matching (i.e. a system of\nvertex-disjoint odd-cycles and edges covering the vertex-set) plus a term\ncomputable in polynomial time. As a consequence, it is possible to bound from\nabove and below the stability number in terms of the matching number of a\nsubgraph having a perfect 2-matching and other quantities computable in\npolynomial time.

In quantum mechanics, these singularities\naccommodate an unexpectedly rich structure and thereby provide a variety of\nphysical phenomena, especially if their properties are controlled properly.\nBased on our recent studies, we present a brief review on the physical aspects\nof such quantum singularities in one dimension. Among the intriguing phenomena\nthat the singularities admit, we mention strong vs weak duality, supersymmetry,\nquantum anholonomy (Berry phase), and a copying process by anomalous caustics.\nWe also show that a partition wall as a singularity in a potential well can\ngive rise to a quantum force which exhibits an interesting temperature behavior\ncharacteristic to the particle statistics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Dec 2003 08:00:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Recently, a criticism of the Yuen protocol, so\ncalled Y-00, was made by Nishioka, and Imai group(Mitsubishi and University of\nTokyo), and they claimed Y-00 is essentially a classical stream cipher. This\npaper shows that the claim is incorrect. In particular, it is shown that the\nrelation $l_i=r_i\\oplus \\tilde{k}_i$, which is their basis for attack, has no\nessential role for any security analysis. In addition, we give a brief\nintroduction of the general logic for the security of Y-00 as direct encryption\nand also for key generation.\n  Several industries have started to make a test-bed of Y-00 for digital\noptical fiber highway, following Kumar's leading work.
