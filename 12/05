However, Sorkin has given a Newtonian argument for 3+1\nSchwarzschild black holes to the effect that fluctuations of such modes provide\nthe horizon with a non-zero quantum mechanical width. This width then\neffectively enforces a cut-off at much larger distances so that the entropy of\nthe thermal atmosphere is negligible in comparison with $A/4G$ for large black\nholes. We generalize and improve this result by giving a relativistic argument\nvalid for any spherical black hole in any dimension. The result is again a\ncut-off $L_c$ at a geometric mean of the Planck scale and the black hole\nradius; in particular, $L_c^d \\sim \\frac{R}{T_H} \\ell_p^{d-2}$.
