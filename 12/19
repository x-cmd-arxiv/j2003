Detailed examination of these dispersed images reveals Doppler\nshifts within the supernova remnant, indicating bulk matter velocities on the\norder of 1000 km/s. These bulk velocities suggest an expanding ring-like\nstructure with additional substructure, inclined to the line of sight. A\ntwo-dimensional spatial/velocity map of the SNR shows a striking spatial\nseparation of redshifted and blueshifted regions, and indicates a need for\nfurther investigation before an adequate 3D model can be found. The radii of\nthe ring-like images of the dispersed spectrum vary with ionization stage,\nsupporting an interpretation of progressive ionization due to passage of the\nreverse shock through the ejecta. Plasma diagnostics with individual emission\nlines of oxygen are consistent with an ionizing plasma in the low density\nlimit, and provide temperature and ionization constraints on the plasma.\nAssuming a pure metal plasma, the mass of oxygen is estimated at ~6 solar\nmasses, consistent with a massive progenitor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Dec 2003 23:14:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

By detailed SSC\nanalysis for Cygnus A and 3C123, we find that the energy density of non-thermal\nelectrons is about 10 times larger than that of magnetic field. We find that\nthe Case III is not acceptable because predicted photon spectra do not give a\ngood fit to the observed one.

One representative example is electron traps in the device\nmaterial or substrate. Electrons can tunnel or hop between a charged and an\nempty trap, or between a trap and a gate electrode. A single trap typically\nproduces telegraph noise and can hence be modeled as a bistable fluctuator.\nSince the distribution of hopping rates is exponentially broad, many traps\nproduce flicker-noise with spectrum close to 1/f. Here we develop a theory of\ndecoherence of a qubit in the environment consisting of two-state fluctuators,\nwhich experience transitions between their states induced by interaction with\nthermal bath. Due to interaction with the qubit the fluctuators produce\n1/f-noise in the qubit's eigenfrequency. We calculate the results of qubit\nmanipulations - free induction and echo signals - in such environment. The main\nproblem is that in many important cases the relevant random process is both\nnon-Markovian and non-Gaussian. Consequently the results in general cannot be\nrepresented by pair correlation function of the qubit eigenfrequency\nfluctuations. Our calculations are based on analysis of the density matrix of\nthe qubit using methods developed for stochastic differential equations. The\nproper generating functional is then averaged over different fluctuators using\nthe so-called Holtsmark procedure. The analytical results are compared with\nsimulations allowing checking accuracy of the averaging procedure and\nevaluating mesoscopic fluctuations.

An agent can express\nthe uncertainty in her knowledge about a piece of information in the form of a\nconfidence level, consisting of a pair of intervals of probability, one for\neach of her belief and doubt. The space of confidence levels naturally leads to\nthe notion of a trilattice, similar in spirit to Fitting's bilattices.\nIntuitively, thep oints in such a trilattice can be ordered according to truth,\ninformation, or precision.

In the\npresent paper we introduce the notion of twisted Novikov homology, which allows\nto obtain better lower bounds for MN(L) than the usual Novikov homology. Our\ntwisted Novikov homology is a module over the Novikov ring Z((t)) but it\ncontains the information coming from the non abelian homological algebra of the\ngroup ring of the fundamental group of the link complement. Using this\ntechnique we prove that the Morse-Novikov number of the knot nC (the connected\nsum of n copies of the Conway knot) is not less than 2n/5 for every positive\ninteger n. We prove also that MN(nC) is not greater than 2n. The same estimates\nhold for the Morse-Novikov numbers of the connected sum of n copies of the\nKinoshita-Terasaka knot.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Dec 2003 08:32:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Dec 2003 12:18:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

One of the\nconsequences of such evolution is the emergence of a small world architecture\ntogether with a scale-free distribution of interactions. Here we show that the\ndomain of parameter space were such structure emerges is related to a phase\ntransition phenomenon. At this transition point, modular architecture\nspontaneously emerges as a byproduct of the DD process.\n  Results: Although the DD models lack any functionality and are thus free from\nmeeting functional constraints, they show the observed features displayed by\nthe real proteome maps when tuned close to a sharp transition point separating\na highly connected graph from a disconnected system. Close to such boundary,\nthe maps are shown to display scale-free hierarchical organization, behave as\nsmall worlds and exhibit modularity.\n  Conclusions: It is conjectured that natural selection tuned the average\nconnectivity in such a way that the network reaches a sparse graph of\nconnections. One consequence of such scenario is that the scaling laws and the\nessential ingredients for building a modular net emerge for free close to such\ntransition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Dec 2003 15:40:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
