The following problem arises in the design of\nnoncoherent multiple-antenna communications systems. How many pairwise\nnonintersecting M_t-dimensional subspaces of an m-dimensional vector space V\nover a field F can be found, if the generator matrices for the subspaces may\ncontain only symbols from a given finite alphabet A subseteq F? The most\nimportant case is when F is the field of complex numbers C; then M_t is the\nnumber of antennas. If A = F = GF(q) it is shown that the number of\nnonintersecting subspaces is at most (q^m-1)/(q^{M_t}-1), and that this bound\ncan be attained if and only if m is divisible by M_t. Furthermore these\nsubspaces remain nonintersecting when ``lifted'' to the complex field. Thus the\nfinite field case is essentially completely solved. In the case when F = C only\nthe case M_t=2 is considered. It is shown that if A is a PSK-configuration,\nconsisting of the 2^r complex roots of unity, the number of nonintersecting\nplanes is at least 2^{r(m-2)} and at most 2^{r(m-1)-1} (the lower bound may in\nfact be the best that can be achieved).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Dec 2003 17:44:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-17"}
