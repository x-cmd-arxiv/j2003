It is then natural to ask if there are any relations between\nthese boundary conditions and the ones provided before. After discussing the\ntechnical foundation of loop quantum cosmology which leads to crucial\ndifferences to the Wheeler-DeWitt quantization, we compare the dynamical\ninitial conditions of loop quantum cosmology with the tunneling and the\nno-boundary proposal and explain why they are closer to the no-boundary\ncondition.
