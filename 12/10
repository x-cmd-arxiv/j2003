Due to the different spin\narrangements of the atoms in the open channel and the atoms in the molecular\nstate, the energy difference between the bound state and the two-atom continuum\nthreshold is experimentally accessible by means of the Zeeman interaction of\nthe atomic spins with a magnetic field. As a result, it is in principle\npossible to vary the scattering length to any value by tuning the magnetic\nfield. This level of experimental control has opened the road for many\nbeautiful experiments, which recently led to the demonstration of coherence\nbetween atoms and molecules.

In the first part\nof the paper we present a class of optimal partition problems involving the\nfirst eigenvalue of the Laplace operator. Beside establishing the existence of\nthe optimal partition, we develop a theory for the extremality conditions and\nthe regularity of minimizers. As a first application of this approach, we give\na new variational characterization of the first curve of the Fu\\v{c}\\'\\i k\nspectrum for the Laplacian, promptly adapted to more general operators. In the\nsecond part we prove a monotonicity formula in the case of many subharmonic\ncomponents and we give an extension to solutions of a class of\nreaction--diffusion equation, providing some Liouville--type theorems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Dec 2003 14:02:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The heat generated by viscous friction produces\na local temperature increase near the tube walls with a consequent decrease of\nthe viscosity and a strong stratification in the viscosity profile. The problem\nof viscous heating in fluids was investigated and reviewed by Costa & Macedonio\n(2003) because of its important implications in the study of magma flows.\nBecause of the strong coupling between viscosity and temperature, the\ntemperature rise due to the viscous heating may trigger instabilities in the\nvelocity field, which cannot be predicted by a simple isothermal Newtonian\nmodel. When viscous heating produces a pronounced peak in the temperature\nprofile near the walls, a triggering of instabilities and a transition to\nsecondary flows can occur because of the stratification in the viscosity\nprofile. In this paper we focus on the thermal and mechanical effects caused by\nviscous heating. We will present the linear stability equations and we will\nshow, as in certain regimes, these effects can trigger and sustain a particular\nclass of secondary rotational flows which appear organised in coherent\nstructures similar to roller vortices.
