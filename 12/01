An extremely skewed, relativistic Fe\nK-alpha emission line and ionized disk reflection spectrum are revealed in\nthese spectra. Self-consistent models for the Fe K-alpha emission line profile\nand disk reflection spectrum rule-out an inner disk radius compatible with a\nSchwarzschild black hole at more than the 8 sigma level of confidence.

The target\nmanifolds for the scalar fields turn out to be para-complex manifolds endowed\nwith a particular kind of special geometry, which we call affine special\npara-Kahler geometry. We give a precise definition and develop the mathematical\ntheory of such manifolds. The relation to the affine special Kahler manifolds\nappearing in Minkowskian N=2 supersymmetry is discussed. Starting from the\ngeneral 5-dimensional vector multiplet action we consider dimensional reduction\nover time and space in parallel, providing a dictionary between the resulting\nEuclidean and Minkowskian theories. Then we reanalyze supersymmetry in four\ndimensions and find that any (para-)holomorphic prepotential defines a\nsupersymmetric Lagrangian, provided that we add a specific four-fermion term,\nwhich cannot be obtained by dimensional reduction.
