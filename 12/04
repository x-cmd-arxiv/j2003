We compared this method with\nother published promoter-prediction systems, and show that the set of promoters\nwhich are detected by this method seems to be substantially similar to that\ndetected by existing methods.\n  Conclusions: The results presented here indicate that the promoter signal is\nthe strongest single motif-based signal in the non-coding functional fraction\nof the genome. They also lend support to the belief that there exists a\nsubstantial subset of promoter regions which share common features and are\ndetectable by a variety of computational methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Dec 2003 14:49:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The only general method of this kind\nis the root model based on the representation of the probability density as a\nsquared absolute value of a certain function, which is referred to as a\npsi-function in analogy with quantum mechanics. The psi-function is represented\nby an expansion in terms of an orthonormal set of functions. It is shown that\nthe introduction of the psi-function allows one to represent the Fisher\ninformation matrix as well as statistical properties of the estimator of the\nstate vector (state estimator) in simple analytical forms. The chi-square test\nis considered to test the hypotheses that the estimated vector converges to the\nstate vector of a general population. The method proposed may be applied to its\nfull extent to solve the statistical inverse problem of quantum mechanics (root\nestimator of quantum states). In order to provide statistical completeness of\nthe analysis, it is necessary to perform measurements in mutually complementing\nexperiments (according to the Bohr terminology). The maximum likelihood\ntechnique and likelihood equation are generalized in order to analyze quantum\nmechanical experiments. It is shown that the requirement for the expansion to\nbe of a root kind can be considered as a quantization condition making it\npossible to choose systems described by quantum mechanics from all statistical\nmodels consistent, on average, with the laws of classical mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Dec 2003 14:14:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
