In the model the processive movement does not need to\nrely on the two heads' coordination in their ATP hydrolysis and mechanical\ncycles. Rather, the ATP hydrolyses at the two heads are independent. The much\nhigher ATPase rate at the trailing head than the leading head makes the motor\nwalk processively in a natural way, with one ATP being hydrolyzed per step. The\nmodel is consistent with the structural study of kinesin and the measured\npathway of the kinesin ATPase. Using the model the estimated driving force of ~\n5.8 pN is in agreements with the experimental results (5~7.5 pN).

Since quantum\ngates that do not preserve the computational basis are necessary for achieving\nquantum speedups, it appears natural to define the quantumness of a quantum\ncircuit using the number of such gates. Intuitively, a reduction in the\nquantumness requires an increase in the amount of classical computation, hence\ngiving a ``quantum and classical tradeoff''.\n  In this paper we present two results on this direction. The first gives an\nasymptotic answer to the question: ``what is the minimum number of\nnon-basis-preserving gates required to generate a good approximation to a given\nstate''. This question is the quantum analogy of the following classical\nquestion, ``how many fair coins are needed to generate a given probability\ndistribution'', which was studied and resolved by Knuth and Yao in 1976. Our\nsecond result shows that any quantum algorithm that solves Grover's Problem of\nsize n using k queries and l levels of non-basis-preserving gates must have\nk*l=\\Omega(n).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Dec 2003 06:30:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Dec 2003 21:06:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-04"}
