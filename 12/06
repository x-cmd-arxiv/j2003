The rate for a satellite to decay its orbit in a host\ngalaxy halo is often severely overestimated when applying ChandraSekhar's\nformula without correcting for the tidal loss of the satellite and the\nadiabactic growth of the host galaxy potential over the Hubble time. As a\nsatellite decays to the inner and denser region of the host galaxy, the high\nambient density speeds up their exchange of energy and angular momentum, but\nshrinks the Roche lobe of the satellite by tides. Eventually both processes of\norbital decay and tidal stripping hang up altogether once the satellite is\nlight enough. These competing processes can be modeled analytically for a\nsatellite if we parametrize the massloss history by an empirical formula. We\nalso incorporate the adiabatic contraction of orbits due to growth of the host\npotential well.

The four filters are centered at 1.495 um (H2O), 1.595 um\n(continuum), 1.66 um (CH4), and 1.75 um (H2O). Using two H2O filters allows us\nto solve for individual objects' reddenings.

We created a model of predicted color-color-color values for\ndifferent spectral types by integrating filter bandpass data with spectra of\nknown stars and brown dwarfs. We validated this model by making photometric\nmeasurements of seven known L and T dwarfs, ranging from L1 - T7.5.

Fine showed that\nthis assumption is connected to the no-hidden-variables theorem of Kochen and\nSpecker (KS theorem). These inequalities give a way to experimentally test the\nKS theorem. The fidelity to the Bell states which is larger than 1/2 is\nsufficient for the experimental confirmation of the KS theorem. Hence, the\nWerner state is enough to test experimentally the KS theorem. Furthermore, it\nis possible to test the KS theorem experimentally using uncorrelated states. An\n$n$-partite uncorrelated state violates the $n$-partite inequality derived here\nby an amount that grows exponentially with $n$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Dec 2003 16:43:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 30 May 2004 19:08:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 30 May 2005 16:45:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

The system-environment\ninteractions are taken into account by including stochastic fluctuating terms\nin the system Hamiltonian. Treating these fluctuations as Gaussian Markov\nprocesses with zero mean and delta function correlation times, we derive an\nexact equation of motion describing the dissipative dynamics for a system of n\nqubits. We then apply this model to study the effect of noise on the quantum\nteleportation and a generic quantum controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate. For the quantum\nCNOT gate, we study the effect of noise on a set of one- and two-qubit quantum\ngates, and show that the results can be assembled together to investigate the\nquality of a quantum CNOT gate operation. We compute the averaged gate fidelity\nand gate purity for the quantum CNOT gate, and investigate phase, bit-flip, and\nflip-flop errors during the CNOT gate operation. The effects of direct\ninter-qubit coupling and fluctuations on the control fields are also studied.\nWe discuss the limitations and possible extensions of this model. In sum, we\ndemonstrate a simple model that enables us to investigate the effect of noise\nin arbitrary quantum circuits under realistic device conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Dec 2003 16:57:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
