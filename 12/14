Such a\nsource-scaling can be exploited to effectively measure geometrical distances as\na function of redshift and thereby constrain dark energy properties, free of\nany assumptions about the galaxy-mass/mass power spectrum (its shape, amplitude\nor growth). Such a geometrical method can yield a ~ 0.03 - 0.07 f_{sky}^{-1/2}\nmeasurement on the dark energy abundance and equation of state, for a\nphotometric redshift accuracy of dz ~ 0.01 - 0.05 and a survey with median\nredshift of ~ 1. While these constraints are weaker than conventional weak\nlensing methods, they provide an important consistency check because the\ngeometrical method carries less theoretical baggage: there is no need to assume\nany structure formation model (e.g. CDM). The geometrical method is at the most\nconservative end of a whole spectrum of methods which obtain smaller errorbars\nby making more restrictive assumptions -- we discuss some examples. Our\ngeometrical approach differs from previous investigations along similar lines\nin three respects. First, the source-scaling we propose to use is less\ndemanding on the photometric redshift accuracy. Second, the scaling works for\nboth galaxy-shear and shear-shear correlations. Third, we find that previous\nstudies underestimate the statistical errors associated with similar\ngeometrical methods, the origin of which is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Dec 2003 05:10:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We show that Lambda^0 hyperons, produced from\nthe QGP, are fully unpolarized. This means that a detection of unpolarized\nLambda^0 hyperons, produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, should\nserve as one of the signatures for the existence of the QGP in intermediate\nstates of ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Dec 2003 15:32:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Packet localization of this type is directly related to entanglement\nin the joint quantum state of electron and ion, and to Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen\nlocalization. Experimental observation of such packet-narrowing effects is\nsuggested via coincidence registration by two detectors, with a fixed position\nof one and varying position of the other. A similar effect, typically with an\nenhanced degree of entanglement, is shown to occur in the case of\nphotodissociation of molecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Dec 2003 17:27:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Jan 2004 20:09:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
