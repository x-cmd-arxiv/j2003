A Pm scan is given for the model case of\nlow-Reynolds-number turbulence. We concentrate on three topics: magnetic-energy\nspectra and saturation levels, the structure of the field lines, and the\nfield-strength distribution. The main results are (1) the folded structure\n(direction reversals at the resistive scale, field lines curved at the scale of\nthe flow) persists from the kinematic to the nonlinear regime; (2) the field\ndistribution is self-similar and appears to be lognormal during the kinematic\nregime and exponential in the saturated state; and (3) the bulk of the magnetic\nenergy is at the resistive scale in the kinematic regime and remains there\nafter saturation, although the spectrum becomes much shallower. We propose an\nanalytical model of saturation based on the idea of partial\ntwo-dimensionalization of the velocity gradients with respect to the local\ndirection of the magnetic folds. The model-predicted spectra are in excellent\nagreement with numerical results. Comparisons with large-Re, moderate-Pm runs\nare carried out to confirm the relevance of these results. New features at\nlarge Re are elongation of the folds in the nonlinear regime from the viscous\nscale to the box scale and the presence of an intermediate nonlinear stage of\nslower-than-exponential magnetic-energy growth accompanied by an increase of\nthe resistive scale and partial suppression of the kinetic-energy spectrum in\nthe inertial range. Numerical results for the saturated state do not support\nscale-by-scale equipartition between magnetic and kinetic energies, with a\ndefinite excess of magnetic energy at small scales.

The measurements\nof the surface resistance have shown that microwave losses in MgB2 are strongly\naffected by the magnetic field in the whole range of temperatures below Tc,\neven for relatively low field values. The results have been accounted for in\nthe framework of the Coffey and Clem model hypothesizing that in different\ntemperature ranges the microwave current induces fluxons to move in different\nregimes. In particular, the results at temperatures close to Tc have been\nquantitatively justified by assuming that fluxons move in the flux-flow regime\nand taking into account the anisotropy of the upper critical field. At low\ntemperatures, the field dependence of the surface resistance follows the law\nexpected in the pinning limit; however, an unusually enhanced field variation\nhas been detected, which could be due to the peculiar fluxon structure of MgB2,\nrelated to the presence of the two gaps. The measurements of the\nsecond-harmonic signals have highlighted several mechanisms responsible for the\nnonlinear response. At low magnetic fields and low temperatures, the nonlinear\nresponse is due to processes involving weak links. At temperatures close to Tc,\na further contribution to the harmonic emission is present; it arises from the\nmodulation of the order parameter by the microwave field and gives rise to a\npeak in the temperature dependence of the harmonic-signal intensity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Dec 2003 13:50:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
