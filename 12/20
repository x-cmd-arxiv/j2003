Exploration of redshift--stellar-population-reddening constraints\nfrom the photometry indicates that the galaxy is indeed at a redshift close to\nthat of 4C23.56, that the age of the most recent significant star formation is\nroughly >~2 Gyr, and that reddening is fairly modest, with more reddening\nrequired for the younger end of stellar age range.

The ratio Eta=N(HeII)/N(HI) varies\napproximately from unity to more than a thousand, with a median value of 62 and\na distribution consistent with the intrinsic spectral indices of quasars. This\nsuggests that the dominant ionizing field is from the accumulated quasar\nradiation, with contributions from other soft sources such as star-forming\nregions and obscured AGN, which do not ionize helium.

Second, we apply a hierarchical\nclustering method. The NCD is universal in that it is not restricted to a\nspecific application area, and works across application area boundaries.

This is analogous to known results for\nincompressible fluids--both the Euler equations and the LAE equations--and it\nshows that for sufficiently smooth solutions, the equations are well-posed for\nshort time.

However, atomic diffraction patterns formed using material\ngratings indicate that material structures also operate as phase masks. In this\nstudy a well collimated beam of sodium atoms is used to illuminate a silicon\nnitride grating with a period of 100 nm. During passage through the grating\nslots atoms acquire a phase shift due to the van der Waals interaction with the\ngrating walls. As a result the relative intensities of the matter-wave\ndiffraction peaks deviate from those expected for a purely absorbing grating.\nThus a complex transmission function is required to explain the observed\ndiffraction envelopes. An optics perspective to the theory of atomic\ndiffraction from material gratings is put forth in the hopes of providing a\nmore intuitive picture concerning the influence of the vdW potential. The van\nder Waals coefficient $C_{3} = 2.7\\pm 0.8{meV nm}^{3}$ is determined by fitting\na modified Fresnel optical theory to the experimental data.
