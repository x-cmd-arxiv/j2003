On average, hydrophobic residues occur preferentially in the core,\nwhereas polar residues tends to occur at the surface of a folded protein. By\nanalyzing the known protein structures, we quantify the degree to which the\nhydrophobicity sequence of a protein correlates with its pattern of surface\nexposure. We have assessed the statistical significance of this correlation for\nseveral hydrophobicity scales in the literature, and find that the computed\ncorrelations are significant but far from optimal. We show that this less than\noptimal correlation arises primarily from the large degree of mutations that\nnaturally occurring proteins can tolerate.
