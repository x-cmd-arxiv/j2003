We consider two scenarios, spiral\nstructure driven by an external bound planet or low mass star and that excited\nby a previous stellar close encounter or flyby. We find that both scenarios\nproduce morphology similar to that observed in the outer disks of HD 141569A\nand HD 100546; moderately open 2-armed outer spiral structure. The outer\ntwo-armed spiral structure observed in the disk of HD 141569A is qualitatively\nreproduced with tidal perturbations from its companion binary HD 141569B,C on a\nprograde orbit near periapse. Our simulation accounts for the outer spiral\narms, but is less successful than the secular model of Augereau and Papaloizou\nat matching the lopsidedness or asymmetry of the disk edge at 300AU. The disk\nhas been previously truncated by the tidal force from the binary. A bound\nobject (stellar or planetary) is unlikely to explain the spiral structure in HD\n100546. A co-eval planet or brown dwarf in the disk of sufficient mass to\naccount for the amplitude of the spiral structure would be detectable in NICMOS\nand STIS images, however existing images reveal no such object. A previous\nencounter could explain the observed structure, provided that the encounter\noccurred less than a few thousand year ago. The object responsible for causing\nthe spiral structure must then be within a few arcminutes of the star. However,\nthe USNO-B proper motion survey reveals no candidate object. Moreover, the\nprobability that a field star encountered HD 100546 in the past few thousand\nyears is very low.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Dec 2003 16:31:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2004 15:36:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2005 19:33:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

The dark matter-only runs agree generally quite\nwell, provided ENZO is run with a comparatively fine root grid and a low\noverdensity threshold for mesh refinement, otherwise the abundance of low-mass\nhalos is suppressed. This is due to the hierarchical particle-mesh method used\nto compute gravitational forces in ENZO, which tends to deliver lower force\nresolution than the tree algorithm of GADGET. At comparable force resolution,\nwe find that the latter offers substantially better performance and lower\nmemory consumption than the present gravity solver in ENZO.
