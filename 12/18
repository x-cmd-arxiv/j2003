In order to further characterize the\nproperties of this halo, parametric King models are fit to the surface density\nof RR Lyrae stars. Using data from both the MACHO and OGLE II microlensing\nsurveys, the model fits yield the center of their distribution at RA =\n05:21.1+-0.8, Dec = -69:45+-6 (J2000) and a core radius of 1.42+-0.12 kpc. As a\ncheck the halo model is compared with RR Lyrae star counts in fields near the\nLMC's periphery previously surveyed with photographic plates. These data,\nhowever, require a cautious interpretation. Several topics regarding the LMC\nstellar halo are discussed. First, the properties of the halo imply a global\nmass-to-light ratio of M/L_V = 5.3+-2.1 and a total mass of 1.6+-0.6 10^10\nM_sun for the LMC in good agreement with estimates based on the rotation curve.\nSecond, although the LMC's disk and halo are kinematically distinct, the shape\nof the surface density profile of the halo is remarkably similar to that of the\nyoung disk. For example, the best-fit exponential scale length for the RR Lyrae\nstars is 1.47+-0.08 kpc, which compares to 1.46 kpc for the LMC's blue light.\nIn the Galaxy, the halo and disk do not resemble each other like this.

Our OVI sample\nprobes the metal content of ~50% of all baryons at z~2.5.

Some 60-70% the Lya forest lines are enriched to observable\nlevels ([O,C/H]>-3.5) while the remaining ~30% of the lines have even lower\nabundances. Thus we have not detected a universal metallicity floor as has been\nsuggested for some Population III enrichment scenaria. In fact, we argue that\nthe bulk of the intergalactic metals formed later than the first stars that are\nthought to have triggered reionization. We do not observe a significant trend\nof decreasing metallicity toward the lower density IGM, at least within regions\nthat would be characterized as filaments in numerical simulations. However, an\n[O/H] enhancement may be present at somewhat high densities. We estimate that\nroughly half of all baryons at these redshifts have been enriched to\n[O/H]>=-3.5. We develop a simple model for the metallicity evolution of the\nIGM, to estimate the chemical yield of galaxies formed prior to z~2.5.

In this paper we are concerned with particle\ncreation during a naked-singularity formation in spherically symmetric\nself-similar collapse without specifying the collapsing matter. In the generic\ncase, the power of particle emission is found to be proportional to the inverse\nsquare of the remaining time to the Cauchy horizon (CH). The constant of\nproportion can be arbitrarily large in the limit to marginally naked\nsingularity. Therefore, the unbounded power is especially striking in the case\nthat an event horizon is very close to the CH because the emitted energy can be\narbitrarily large in spite of a cutoff expected from quantum gravity. Above\nresults suggest the instability of the CH in spherically symmetric self-similar\nspacetime from quantum field theory and seem to support the existence of a\nsemiclassical cosmic censor. The divergence of redshifts and blueshifts of\nemitted particles is found to cause the divergence of power to positive or\nnegative infinity, depending on the coupling manner of scalar fields to\ngravity. On the other hand, it is found that there is a special class of\nself-similar spacetimes in which the semiclassical instability of the CH is not\nefficient. The analyses in this paper are based on the geometric optics\napproximation, which is justified in two dimensions but needs justification in\nfour dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Dec 2003 20:13:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Feb 2004 14:01:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The model naturally gives quasi-degenerate neutrinos that are bi-largely\nmixed, in agreement with observations. Furthermore, the mixings in the quark\nsector are constrained to be small, making it a complete model of the flavor\nstructure. Moreover, it has the interesting property that CP-violation in the\nleptonic sector is maximal (unless vanishing). The model exhibit a close\nrelation between the slepton and lepton sectors and we derive the slepton\nspectra that are compatible with neutrino data and the present bounds on\nflavor-violating charged lepton decays. The prediction for the branching ratio\nof the decay tau -> mu gamma has a lower limit of 10^{-9}. In addition, the\noverall neutrino mass scale is constrained to be larger than 0.3 eV. Thus, the\nmodel will be tested in the very near future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Dec 2003 19:03:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

These theories have\nequivalent 4D dual descriptions, in which the electroweak symmetry is\ndynamically broken by non-trivial infrared dynamics of some gauge interaction,\nwhose coupling g and size N satisfy g^2N > 16pi^2. Such theories allow one to\ncalculate electroweak radiative corrections, including the oblique parameters\nS, T and U, as long as g^2N/16pi^2 and N are large. We study how the duality\nbetween the 4D and 5D theories manifests itself in the computation of various\nphysical quantities. In particular, we study a warped 5D theory where the\nelectroweak symmetry is broken by boundary conditions at the infrared brane. We\nshow that S exceeds the experimental bound if the minimal theory is in a weakly\ncoupled regime. This requires either an extension of the model or departure\nfrom weak coupling.

In this picture, the coordinate base units\nin gravity-induced spacetime metric are defined by the standard clock and ruler\nequipped by the observer, and duplicated onto the every position of the whole\nuniverse. In contrast, the local intrinsic base units of spacetime in\ngravitational field are defined by the length and duration of physical events\nintervals in the same-type standard clock and ruler which are really located at\nevery position of the universe. In principle, the reading number of the\nstandard clock is counted by the undergone times of unit intervals defined\ndepending on a certain kind of local intrinsic events. But the size of the base\nunits of spacetime is essentially depicted by the length of the line segment,\nwhich is cut from the absolute background of spacetime by the local intrinsic\nevents of unit interval. The effect of gravitation is just to change the length\nof this segment for base spacetime units. On the basis of such a physical\npicture of spacetime, in a fairly natural way we re-derive a new classical\ndynamical equation which satisfies a more realistic and moderately general\nprinciple of relativity. To further examine this physical picture including of\ngravitation and spacetime, we also reinterpret the gravitational redshifts for\nsolar gravity tests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Dec 2003 08:39:35 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Sat, 19 Sep 2015 01:12:04 GMT"},{"version":"v11","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2016 15:16:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Nov 2006 09:20:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2011 01:30:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2011 17:25:47 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 12 Feb 2012 02:33:43 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2012 11:01:14 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2012 03:15:52 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2012 06:59:04 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2013 07:59:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

The modeling framework used is time-discrete\ndeterministic dynamical systems, with a finite set of states for each of the\nvariables. The simplest examples of such models are Boolean networks, in which\nvariables have only two possible states. The use of a larger number of possible\nstates allows a finer discretization of experimental data and more than one\npossible mode of action for the variables, depending on threshold values.\nFurthermore, with a suitable choice of state set, one can employ powerful tools\nfrom computational algebra, that underlie the reverse-engineering algorithm,\navoiding costly enumeration strategies. To perform well, the algorithm requires\nwildtype together with perturbation time courses. This makes it suitable for\nsmall to meso-scale networks rather than networks on a genome-wide scale. The\ncomplexity of the algorithm is quadratic in the number of variables and cubic\nin the number of time points. The algorithm is validated on a recently\npublished Boolean network model of segment polarity development in Drosophila\nmelanogaster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Dec 2003 22:12:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Likewise,\none can give an information-theoretic interpretation to evolutions by defining\nthe entropy of a completely positive map. This entropy gives the rate at which\nthe informational content of the evolution can be compressed. One cannot\ncompress this information and still have the evolution act on an unknown state,\nbut we demonstrate a general scheme to do so probabilistically.

We\nargue that a natural generalization of the auxiliary assumption is actually\nstrong enough to yield the Born rule itself, but that Zurek's argument and\nprotocol can be adapted to do without this assumption, at the cost of using\nenvariance of probability in both directions. We consider alternative\nmotivations for envariance, one based on the no-signalling constraint that\nactions on one subsystem of a quantum system not allow signalling to another\nsubsystem entirely distinct from the first, and another which is perhaps\nstrongest in the context of a relative-state interpretation of quantum\nmechanics.
