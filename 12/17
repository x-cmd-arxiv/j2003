Attention\nfocuses on how the relative abundance of these different orbit types and the\ntransition rate between sticky and wildly chaotic orbits depends on amplitude\nm_0, and on the extent to which these quantities can be altered by weak\nfriction and/or noise and by pseudo-random variations in the driving frequency,\nidealized as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with (in general) nonzero\nautocorrelation time t_c.

We present results of an\nextensive study of all aspects of the PLC effect within the context a model\nthat reproduces this crossover. A study of the distribution of the Lyapunov\nexponents as a function of strain rate shows that it changes from a small set\nof positive exponents in the chaotic regime to a dense set of null exponents in\nthe scaling regime. As the latter feature is similar to the GOY shell model for\nturbulence, we compare our results with the GOY model. Interestingly, the null\nexponents in our model themselves obey a power law. The configuration of\ndislocations is visualized through the slow manifold analysis. This shows that\nwhile a large proportion of dislocations are in the pinned state in the chaotic\nregime, most of them are at the threshold of unpinning in the scaling regime.\nThe model qualitatively reproduces the different types of deformation bands\nseen in experiments. At high strain rates where propagating bands are seen, the\nmodel equations are reduced to the Fisher-Kolmogorov equation for propagative\nfronts. This shows that the velocity of the bands varies linearly with the\nstrain rate and inversely with the dislocation density, consistent with the\nknown experimental results.

The algorithm is based on the\nHamiltonian formalism in the framework of which Maxwell's equations for passive\nmedia are shown to be equivalent to the first-order equation, $\\partial\n\\Psi/\\partial t = {\\cal H}\\Psi$, where ${\\cal H}$ is a linear differential\noperator (Hamiltonian) acting on a multi-dimensional vector $\\Psi$ built of the\nelectromagnetic inductions and auxiliary matter fields describing the medium\nresponse. The initial value problem is then solved by means of a modified time\nleapfrog method in combination with the Fourier pseudospectral method applied\non a non-uniform grid that is constructed by a change of variables and designed\nto enhance the sampling efficiency near medium interfaces. The algorithm is\nshown to be highly accurate at relatively low computational costs. An excellent\nagreement with previous theoretical and experimental studies of the gratings is\ndemonstrated by numerical simulations using our algorithm. In addition, our\nalgorithm allows one to see real time dynamics of long leaving resonant\nexcitations of electromagnetic fields in the gratings in the entire frequency\nrange of the initial wide band wave packet as well as formation of the\nreflected and transmitted wave fronts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Dec 2003 04:38:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
