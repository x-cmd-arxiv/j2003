The\nsuper-critical regions inside and outside the Aoki phase are characterized by\nthe existence of a density of near-zero modes of the (hermitian) Wilson-Dirac\noperator, and thus by a non-vanishing pion condensate. Inside the Aoki phase,\nthis density is built up from extended near-zero modes, while outside the Aoki\nphase, there is a non-vanishing density of exponentially localized near-zero\nmodes, which occur in \"exceptional\" gauge-field configurations. Nevertheless,\nno Goldstone excitations appear outside the Aoki phase, and the existence of\nGoldstone excitations may therefore be used to define the Aoki phase in both\nthe quenched and unquenched theories. We show that the density of localized\nnear-zero modes gives rise to a divergent pion two-point function, thus\nproviding an alternative mechanism for satisfying the relevant Ward identity in\nthe presence of a non-zero order parameter. This divergence occurs when we take\na \"twisted\" quark mass to zero, and we conclude that quenched QCD with Wilson\nfermions is well-defined only with a non-vanishing twisted mass. We show that\nthis peculiar behavior of the near-zero-mode density is special to the quenched\ntheory by demonstrating that this density vanishes in the unquenched theory\noutside the Aoki phase.

We defined an algebra\nthat characterizes the symmetry of the Laplacian and named it the magnetic\nalgebra. We proved that the space of functions on which the Laplacian acts is\nan irreducible representation space of the magnetic algebra. In this sense the\nmagnetic algebra completely characterizes the quantum mechanics in the magnetic\ntorus. We developed a new method for Fourier analysis for the magnetic torus\nand used it to solve the eigenvalue problem of the Laplacian.

This\nrepresentation has all distinguishing features of the quantum model.

Our representation is not\nstandard model with hidden variables. In particular, this is not a reduction of\nquantum model to the classical one.

For constant potentials there is no effect.\nBut the coupling between rapidly varying electromagnetic fields and the quantum\nfluctuations in time should be detectable.\n  We consider a variation on the Stern-Gerlach experiment in which a particle\nwith a non-zero electric dipole moment is sent through a rapidly varying\nelectric field, oriented parallel to the particle's trajectory. The\nSchroedinger equation predicts changes to the precession frequency of the wave\nfunction about the trajectory but no physical splitting of the beam.
