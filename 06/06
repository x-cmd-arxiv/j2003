The model consists of two components: a concentrated\ncomponent which traces the light distribution, and a more extended power-law\ncomponent (rho propto r^-n) which represents the dark matter. We find that lens\ngalaxies have total mass profiles which are nearly isothermal, or slightly\nsteeper, on the several-kiloparsec radial scale spanned by the lensed images.\nIn the limit of a single-component, power-law radial profile, the model implies\nn=2.07+/-0.13, consistent with isothermal (n=2).

These are the best statistical\nconstraints yet obtained on the mass profiles of lenses, and provide clear\nevidence for a small but non-zero dark matter mass fraction in the inner\nregions of early-type galaxies.

The idea\nis based on the earlier proposal by various authors that UXORs are\nnearly-edge-on disks in which hydrodynamic fluctuations could cause clumps of\ndust and gas to cross the line of sight. However, because the standard disk\nmodels have a flaring geometry, it is mostly the outer regions of the disk that\nobscure the star. The time scales for such obscuration events would be too long\nto match the observed time scales of weeks to months. Recent 2-D\nself-consistent models of Herbig Ae/Be protoplanetary disks (Dullemond et al.\n2002,2003 henceforth D02/DD03), however, have indicated that for Herbig Ae/Be\nstar disks there exists, in addition to the usual flared disks, also a new\nclass of disks: those that are fully self-shadowed. Only their puffed-up inner\nrim (at the dust evaporation radius) is directly irradiated by the star, while\nthe disk at larger radius resides in the shadow of the rim. For these disks\nthere exist inclinations at which the line of sight towards the star skims the\nupper parts of the puffed-up inner rim, while passing high over the surface of\nouter disk regions. Small hydrodynamic fluctuations in the puffed-up inner rim\ncould then be held responsible for the extinction events seen in UXORs. If this\nidea is correct, it makes a prediction for the shape of the SEDs of these\nstars. It was shown by D02/DD03 that flared disks have a strong far-IR excess\nand can be classified as `group I' (in the classification of Meeus et al.\n2001), while self-shadowed disks have a relatively weak far-IR excess and are\nclassified as `group II'. Our model therefore predicts that UXORs belong to the\n`group II' sources. We show that this correlation is indeed found within a\nsample of 86 Herbig Ae/Be stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jun 2003 16:31:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Jul 2003 11:34:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The knot emission is consistent with the\nX-rays being created by the inverse Compton scattering of the cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) photons and requires jet bulk Lorentz factors of a few\n(Gamma_{bulk} ~ 5-7). We discuss the emission mechanisms that may be\nresponsible for the jet emission. We present new VLA data of the core and jet,\nand discuss the relation between the extended radio and X-ray emission.\nExtended emission observed in several GPS sources has been interpreted as a\nsignature of the source past activity, while the GPS source is young and newly\nexpanded. We argue that B2~0738+313 may be an example of a new class of radio\nsources similar to the FRII radio galaxies in their high jet bulk velocities,\nbut with the powerful GPS-like nucleus.\n  B2 0738+313 also has two damped Lyman-alpha systems along the line of sight,\nat z_{abs} = 0.0912 and 0.2212. We discuss the possible connection between the\nX-ray absorption (7.2+/-0.9 e20 cm(-2)) detected in the ACIS spectrum and these\ntwo intervening absorbers. We also investigate an extended structure within the\ncentral 10 arcsec of the core in the relation to structure seen in the optical.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jun 2003 20:47:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The\nconcerns expressed by Armitage and Hu that our results could be due to a change\nin the mirror plane are as important as they are obvious. In fact the first\npart of their comment merely restates the results of Simon and Varma [3] about\nthe relationship and contrast of effects due to time reversal symmetry breaking\nand those caused by crystallographic changes. In any test of time reversal\nsymmetry one must ensure that parity alone is not inducing the observed\nchanges. We have indeed considered this issue very carefully in the course of\nour study [2] and it is precisely the lack of temperature dependent structural\nchanges significant enough to explain the magnitude of the observed dichroism\nthat forced us to conclude that time reversal symmetry breaking is the only\nplausible explanation.
