A large fraction of the cores analyzed are\n``quiescent'', and more than half are identified as ``coherent''. The fact that\ndynamically evolving cores in highly supersonic turbulent flows can be\nquiescent may be understood because cores lie at the stagnation points of\nconvergent turbulent flows, where compression is at a maximum, and relative\nvelocity differences are at a minimum. The coherence may be due to an\nobservational effect related to the length and concentration of the material\ncontributing to the line. The velocity dispersion of the our cores often has\nits local maximum at small offsets from the column density maximum, suggesting\nthat the core is the dense region behind a shock. Such a configuration is often\nfound in observations of molecular cloud cores, and argues in favor of the\ngravoturbulent scenario of stellar birth as it is not expected in\nstar-formation models based on magnetic mediation.

Finally, cores in simulations driven at large scales are more\nfrequently quiescent and coherent, and have more realistic ratios of $M_{\\rm\nvir}/M$, supporting the notion that molecular cloud turbulence is driven at\nlarge scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jun 2003 00:56:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2004 18:05:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The nonorthogonality of\npolarization modes is incorporated in a statistical model of radio polarization\nto account for the deviations from mode orthogonality that are observed in the\npulsar. The model is used to interpret the rapid PA change and modal connecting\nbridge as a longitudinally-resolved transition between modes of nonorthogonal\npolarization. Thus, the modal PA trajectories are argued to reflect the\npulsar's true viewing geometry. This interpretation is consistent with the\npulsar's morphological classification, preserves the Radhakrishnan & Cooke\nmodel of pulsar radio emission, and avoids the complication that the modal\nconnecting bridge might be produced by some other emission mechanism. The\nstatistical model's ability to simulate the rich variety of polarization\nproperties observed in the emission lends additional support to the model's\napplicability and its underlying assumption that the polarization modes occur\nsimultaneously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jun 2003 15:38:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We apply these ideas to develop a formulation of quantum\ncosmology based on the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for a Friedman-Robertson-Walker\nmodel coupled to a real scalar field. We solve the Hilbert space problem,\nconstruct the observables, introduce a new set of the wave functions of the\nuniverse, reformulate the quantum theory in terms of the latter, reduce the\nproblem of time to the determination of a Hamiltonian operator acting in\nL^2(\\R)\\oplus L^2(\\R), show that the factor-ordering problem is irrelevant for\nthe kinematics of the quantum theory, and propose a formulation of the\ndynamics. Our method allows for a genuine probabilistic interpretation and a\nunitary Schreodinger time-evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jun 2003 16:46:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Aug 2003 11:07:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2004 11:02:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}

We consider the interaction of ultrahigh energy neutrinos in the\natmosphere and compare extensive air showers from TeV black hole formation and\nfragmentation with standard model processes. Departures from the standard model\npredictions arise in the interaction cross sections and in the multiplicity of\nsecondary particles.
