The\nproperties of the SN are investigated through a comparison with spectra of the\nType Ic hypernovae SNe 1997ef and 1998bw. (Hypernovae being a tentatively\ndefined class of SNe with very broad absorption features: these features\nsuggest a large velocity of the ejected material and possibly a large explosion\nkinetic energy.) Comparison with spectra of other hypernovae shows that the\nspectrum of SN 2003dh obtained on 2003 May 8 and 9, i.e., 34-35 rest-frame days\nafter the GRB (for z=0.1685), are similar to those of SN 1997ef obtained ~34-42\ndays after the fiducial time of explosion of that SN. The match with SN 1998bw\nspectra is not as good (at rest 7300-8000 A, but again spectra obtained ~33-43\ndays after GRB 980425 are preferred. This indicates that the SN may have\nintermediate properties between SNe 1997ef and 1998bw. Based on the analogy\nwith the other hypernovae, the time of explosion of SN 2003dh is then\nconstrained to be between -8 and +2 days of the GRB. The Si and O P-Cygni lines\nof SN 2003dh seem comparable to those of SN 1997ef, which suggests that the\nejected mass in SN 2003dh may match that in SN 1997ef. Polarization was\nmarginally detected at optical wavelengths. This is consistent with\nmeasurements of the late afterglow, implying that it mostly originated in the\ninterstellar medium of the host galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Jun 2003 13:17:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Jul 2003 07:48:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
