Two main features emerge when considering an Al\nnanograin coated with Al oxide: (i) The electronic energy response fluctuates\nstrongly in the presence of disorder, from level to level and excitation to\nexcitation. Such fluctuations produce a dramatic sample dependence of the\ntunneling spectra. On the other hand, for excitations that are energetically\naccessible at low applied bias voltages, the magnitude of the response,\nreflected in the renormalization of the single-electron energy levels, is\nsmaller than the average spacing between energy levels. (ii) If the tunneling\nand electronic relaxation time scales are such as to admit a significant\nnon-equilibrium population of the excited nanoparticle states, it should be\npossible to realize much higher spectral densities of resonances than have been\nobserved to date in such devices.

The linearly\npolarised photon beam is produced from coherent bremsstrahlung radiation by 178\nGeV unpolarised electrons incident on an aligned Si crystal, acting as a\nradiator. The linear polarisation of the photon beam is characterised by\nmeasuring the asymmetry in electron-positron pair production in a Ge crystal,\nfor different crystal orientations.

An identification schema that follows the logical\ndecomposition of the ATLAS detector has been introduced allowing identification\nof individual readout channels as well as other parts of the detector, in\nparticular detector elements. These identifiers provide a sort of ?glue?\nallowing, for example, the connection of raw event data to their detector\ndescription for position calculation or alignment corrections, as well as fast\naccess to subsets of the event data for event trigger selection. There are two\nimportant requirements on the software to support such an identification\nscheme. First is the possibility to formally specify these identifiers in terms\nof their structure and allowed values. And second is to generate different\nforms of the identifiers optimised in terms of access efficiency to information\ncontent, compactness or search key efficiency. We present here the generic\ntoolkit developed in the context of the ATLAS experiment to primarily provide\nthe identification of the readout channels and detector elements. The\narchitecture of the toolkit is decomposed into three parts: an XML-based\ndictionary containing the formal specification of a particular range of\nidentifiers, a set of various identifier classes (offering various level of\ncompaction), and finally a set of ?helper? classes, specific for each detector\nsystem, which serve as intermediaries between the dictionary and the identifier\nclasses to create, manipulate and interpret the identifiers. This architecture\nwill be described as well as the various applications of this identification\nscheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jun 2003 17:01:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
