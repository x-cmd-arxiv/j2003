Estimates of the EGRB flux and\nspectrum, obtained by modeling the Galactic emission, have produced a variety\nof (sometimes conflicting) results. The latest analysis of the EGRET data found\nan isotropic flux I_x=1.45+-0.05 above 100 MeV, in units of 10^-5 s^-1 cm^-2\nsr^-1. We analyze the EGRET data in search for robust constraints on the EGRB\nflux, finding the gamma-ray sky strongly dominated by Galactic foreground even\nat high latitudes, with no conclusive evidence for an additional isotropic\ncomponent. The gamma-ray intensity measured towards the Galactic poles is\nsimilar to or lower than previous estimates of I_x. The high latitude profile\nof the gamma-ray data is disk-like for 40<|b[deg]|<70, and even steeper for\n|b|>70; overall it exhibits strong Galactic features and is well fit by a\nsimple Galactic model. Based on the |b|>40 data we find that I_x<0.5 at a 99%\nconfidence level, with evidence for a much lower flux. We show that\ncorrelations with Galactic tracers, previously used to identify the Galactic\nforeground and estimate I_x, are not satisfactory; the results depend on the\ntracers used and on the part of the sky examined, because the Galactic emission\nis not linear in the Galactic tracers and exhibits spectral variations across\nthe sky. The low EGRB flux favored by our analysis places stringent limits on\nextragalactic scenarios involving gamma-ray emission, such as radiation from\nblazars, intergalactic shocks and production of ultra-high energy cosmic rays\nand neutrinos. We suggest methods by which future gamma-ray missions such as\nGLAST and AGILE could indirectly identify the EGRB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jun 2003 19:13:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 3 Apr 2004 19:10:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

For\ntraditional unapodized apertures at high Strehl ratios, bright speckles pinned\nto the bright Airy rings are part of an antisymmetric perturbation of the\nperfect PSF, arising from the term that is first order in the residual phase\nerror. There are two symmetric second degree terms.

Associated with such\nexpanded multichannel interactions are algebraic multichannel scattering\nmatrices. The matrix structure of the inherent Green functions not only\nfacilitates extraction of the sub-threshold (compound nucleus) bound state\nspin-parity values and energies but also readily gives the energies and widths\nof resonances in the scattering regime. We exploited also the ability of the\nsturmian-expansion method to deal with non-local interactions to take into\naccount the strong non-local effects introduced by the Pauli principle. As an\nexample, we have used the collective model (to second order) to define a\nmultichannel potential matrix for low energy neutron-C12 scattering allowing\ncoupling between the 0+ (ground), 2+ (4.4389 MeV), and 0+ (7.64 MeV) states.\nThe algebraic S matrix for this system has been evaluated and the sub-threshold\nbound states as well as cross sections and polarizations as functions of energy\nare predicted. The results are reflected in the actual measured data, and are\nshown to be consistent with expectations as may be based upon a shell model\ndescription of the target and of the compound nucleus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jun 2003 09:02:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
