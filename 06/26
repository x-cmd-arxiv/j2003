We have made a spectroscopic survey of a sample of 28\nmassive star forming cores associated with water masers. An optically thick\nline of HCN (3-2) was used in combination with optically thin lines [H^{13}CN\n(3-2) or C^{34}S (5-4), (3-2), and (2-1)], to identify ``blue'' line profiles\nthat can indicate inflow. Comparing intensities for 18 double-peaked line\nprofiles yields 11 blue and 3 red profiles that are statistically significant.\nIn the full sample of 28 sources, 12 show blue profiles and 6 show red profiles\nthat are statistically significant based on the velocity offsets of lines that\nare optically thick from those that are optically thin. These results indicate\nthat HCN (3-2) emission may trace inflow in regions forming high-mass stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jun 2003 22:48:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Special\nattention is paid to the photon-trapping effects, the effects that photons are\ntrapped within accretion flow and are swallowed by a black hole, with little\nbeing radiated away. It is found that when flow luminosity is below about twice\nthe Eddington luminosity (L<2L_E) photon trapping is ineffective and the SED\nshifts to the higher-energy side as L increases. The peak frequency at which\nthe SED reaches its peak becomes at maximum three times higher than that given\nby the standard-disk model, which might resolve the so-called 'too hot\naccretion disk problem.' When L>2L_E, in contrast the peak frequency of the SED\ntends to decrease with increase of mass-accretion rate. This is due to enhanced\nphoton-trapping. Since high-energy photons are generated near the equatorial\nplane, they can be more effectively trapped in flow than low-energy ones and,\nhence, the high energy part of radiation is suppressed. Finally, the observed\ntime variation of IC 342 S1, which is an ultraluminous X-ray source, in the\nX-ray HR diagram can be explained by the modulation of the mass accretion rate.\nIn comparison with the observational data, we estimate the mass of black hole\nin IC 342 S1 is around 100 solar mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jun 2003 02:55:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

This is, in fact, one\nof the major problems when facing the study of stellar populations in star\nclusters and galaxies. Typically, the observational efforts have been aimed to\nfind the most appropriate spectroscopic indicators in order to avoid, as far as\npossible, degeneracies in the parameter space. However, from a practical point\nof view, the most suited observables are not, necessarily, those that provide\nmore orthogonality in that parameter space, but those that give the best\nbalance between parameter degeneracy and sensitivity to signal-to-noise ratio\nper Angstrom, SN_A. In order to achieve the minimum combined total error in the\nderived physical parameters, this work discusses how the functional dependence\nof typical line-strength indices and colors on SN_A allows to define a\nsuitability parameter which helps to obtain better realistic combinations of\nspectroscopic data. As an example, we discuss in more detail the problem of\nbreaking the well known age-metallicity degeneracy in relatively old stellar\npopulations, comparing the suitability of different spectroscopic diagrams for\na simple stellar population of solar metallicity and 12 Gyr old.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jun 2003 14:59:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Instead we\nformulate a new finite-dimensional matrix CS model as an approximation to the\nCS theory on the strip.

This paper establishes the converse: Each continuous tensor\nproduct systems of Hilbert spaces comes with measure types of distributions of\nrandom (closed) sets in [0,1] or $R_+$. These measure types are stationary and\nfactorise over disjoint intervals. In a special case of this construction, the\ncorresponding measure type is an invariant of the product system and the range\nof the invariant is characterized.\n  Moreover, based on a detailed study of this kind of measure types, we\nconstruct for each stationary factorizing measure type a continuous tensor\nproduct systems of Hilbert spaces such that this measure type arises as the\nbefore mentioned invariant.\n  The measure types of the above described kind are connected with\nrepresentations of the corresponding $L^\\infty$-spaces. This leads to direct\nintegral representations of the elements of a given product system which\ncombine well under tensor products. Using this structure in a constructive way,\nwe can relate to any (type III) product system a product system of type $II_0$\npreserving isomorphy classes. Thus, the classification of type III product\nsystems reduces to that of type II ones.\n  Further, we show that all consistent measurable structures on an algebraic\ncontinuous tensor product systems of Hilbert spaces yield isomorphic product\nsystems. Thus the measurable structure of a continuous tensor product systems\nof Hilbert spaces is essentially determined by its algebraic one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jun 2003 17:04:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In a number of recent experiments with food-and-mouth disease\nvirus, a deleterious mutant, was found to avoid extinction and remain in the\npopulation for long periods of time. This observation was called quasispecies\nmemory. The origin of quasispecies memory is not fully understood.\n  Results. We propose and analyze a simple model of complementation between the\nwild type virus and a mutant that has an impaired ability of cell entry. The\nmutant will go extinct unless it is recreated from the wild type through\nmutations. However, under phenotypic mixing-and-hiding as a mechanism of\ncomplementation, the time to extinction in the absence of mutations increases\nwith increasing multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.). The mutant's frequency at\nequilibrium under selection-mutation balance also increases with increasing\nm.o.i. At high m.o.i., a large fraction of mutant genomes are encapsidated with\nwild-type protein, which enables them to infect cells as efficiently as the\nwild type virions, and thus increases their fitness to the wild-type level.\nMoreover, even at low m.o.i. the equilibrium frequency of the mutant is higher\nthan predicted by the standard quasispecies model, because a fraction of mutant\nvirions generated from wild-type parents will also be encapsidated by wild-type\nprotein.\n  Conclusions. Our model predicts that phenotypic hiding will strongly\ninfluence the population dynamics of viruses, particularly at high m.o.i., and\nwill also have important effects on the mutation--selection balance at low\nm.o.i. The delay in mutant extinction and increase in mutant frequencies at\nequilibrium may, at least in part, explain memory in quasispecies populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jun 2003 01:33:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

For relatively short molecules at normal temperatures heat\nconduction is dominated by the harmonic part of the molecular force-field. We\ndevelop a general theory for the heat conduction through harmonic chains in\n3-dimensions. A Landauer-type expression for the heat conduction is obtained,\nin agreement with other recent studies. We use this formalism to study the heat\nconduction properties of alkanes. For relatively short (1-30 carbon atoms)\nchains the length and temperature dependence of the molecular heat conduction\nresult from the balance of three factors: (i) The molecular frequency spectrum\nin relation to the frequency cutoff of the thermal reservoirs, (ii) the degree\nof localization of the molecular normal modes and (iii) the molecule-heat\nreservoirs coupling. The fact that molecular modes at different frequency\nregimes have different localization properties gives rise to intricate\ndependence of the heat conduction on molecular length at different\ntemperatures. For example, the heat conduction increases with molecular length\nfor short molecular chains at low temperatures. Similar considerations apply\nfor isotopically substituted disordered chains. Finally, we compare the heat\nconduction obtained from this microscopic calculation to that estimated by\nconsidering the molecule as a cylinder characterized by a macroscopic heat\nconduction typical to organic solids.
