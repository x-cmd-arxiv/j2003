This feature is probably the same\nstructure that was modeled as an absorption edge in an earlier BeppoSAX\nobservation.

After corrections for reddening, the colors and magnitudes of the\nclusters were converted to ages and masses, and the resulting mass\ndistributions were searched for the effects of fading, evaporation, and\nsize-of-sample bias. The data show a clear signature of cluster fading below\nthe detection threshold. The initial cluster mass function (ICMF) was\ndetermined by fitting the mass and age distributions with cluster population\nmodels. These models suggest a new method to determine the ICMF that is nearly\nindependent of fading or disruption and is based on the slope of a correlation\nbetween age and the maximum cluster mass in equally spaced intervals of\nlog-age. For a nearly uniform star formation rate, this correlation has a slope\nequal to 1/(alpha-1) for an ICMF of dn(M)/dM proportional to M^-alpha. We\ndetermine that alpha is between 2 and 2.4 for the LMC and SMC using this method\nplus another method in which models are fit to the mass distribution integrated\nover age and to the age distribution integrated over mass.

The oldest clusters correspond in age and mass to halo globular clusters in\nthe Milky Way.
