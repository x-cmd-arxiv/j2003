The central claim of\nthis paper is that a more nuanced understanding of mathematical proof and\ndiscovery may be achieved by paying attention to the aspects of mathematical\nargumentation which can be captured by informal, rather than formal, logic. Two\naccounts of argumentation are considered: the pioneering work of Stephen\nToulmin [The uses of argument, Cambridge University Press, 1958] and the more\nrecent studies of Douglas Walton, [e.g. The new dialectic: Conversational\ncontexts of argument, University of Toronto Press, 1998]. The focus of both of\nthese approaches has largely been restricted to natural language argumentation.\nHowever, Walton's method in particular provides a fruitful analysis of\nmathematical proof. He offers a contextual account of argumentational\nstrategies, distinguishing a variety of different types of dialogue in which\narguments may occur. This analysis represents many different fallacious or\notherwise illicit arguments as the deployment of strategies which are sometimes\nadmissible in contexts in which they are inadmissible. I argue that\nmathematical proofs are deployed in a greater variety of types of dialogue than\nhas commonly been assumed. I proceed to show that many of the important\nphilosophical and pedagogical problems of mathematical proof arise from a\nfailure to make explicit the type of dialogue in which the proof is introduced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jun 2003 21:21:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-03"}
