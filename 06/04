A statistical model is used to\nderive the general, three-dimensional statistics that govern radio polarization\nmeasurements. The statistics are derived for specific cases of source-intrinsic\npolarization, with an emphasis on the orthogonal polarization modes in pulsar\nradio emission.

We present here new ray-shooting\nresults, based on a high resolution (1024^3 particles in a 320 Mpc/h box)\nlarge-scale structure simulation normalized to the WMAP observations. We follow\nlight rays through a pseudo-3D matter distribution approximated by up to 38\nlens planes, and evaluate the occurrence of arcs for various source redshifts.\nWe find that the frequency of strongly lensed background sources is a steep\nfunction of source redshift: the optical depth for giant arcs increases by a\nfactor of five when the background sources are moved from redshift z_s = 1.0 to\nz_s = 1.5. This is a consequence of a moderate decrease of the critical surface\nmass density for lensing, combined with the very steep cluster mass function at\nthe high mass end. Our results are consistent with those of Bartelmann et al.\n(1998) if we - as they did - restrict all sources to be exactly at z_s = 1. But\nif we allow for a more realistic distribution of source redshifts extending to\nor beyond z_s > 1.5, the apparent discrepancy vanishes: the frequency of arcs\nis increased by about a factor of ten as compared to previous estimates, and\nresults in roughly one arc per 20 square degrees over the sky. This prediction\nfor an LCDM model is then in good agreement with the observed frequency of\narcs. Hence we consider the ``missing arc'' problem for a concordance LCDM\ncosmology to be solved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jun 2003 15:45:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Because iron is ferromagnetic, it\nis expected to improve the field dependence of Jc by shielding of the external\nfield for low magnetic fields. However, transport and magnetic measurements of\nJc reveal that Jc in MgB2/Fe is improved far beyond the effect of simple\nmagnetic shielding. The transport measurements in external field show that Jc\ninitially decreases with the field. This is followed by an increase for\nintermediate fields and again a decrease for high fields, resembling the ?peak\neffect?. The value of Jc in the field range of this peak effect is higher than\nthe Jc without iron sheath. The field range of improved Jc widens with\ndecreasing the temperature, shifting to the higher values of the field. The\nexplanation of this phenomenon is suggested in terms of a model predicting the\noccurrence of overcritical state, as a result of interaction between partly\nvortex filled superconductor and a magnet. In this model, the currents are\npushed into vortex-free volume of the superconductor, effectively increasing\nits value of loss-free current.

By choosing an appropriate holomorphic variation,\nthe Konishi anomaly equations correctly reproduce the loop equations in the\ncorresponding three-matrix model. We write down the field theory loop equations\nexplicitly by using a noncommutative product of resolvents peculiar to N=1*\ntheories. The field theory resolvents are identified with those in the matrix\nmodel in the same manner as for the generic N=1 gauge theories. We cover all\nthe classical gauge groups. In SO/Sp cases, both the one-loop holomorphic\npotential and the Konishi anomaly term involve twisting of index loops to\nchange a one-loop oriented diagram to an unoriented diagram. The field theory\nloop equations for these cases show certain inhomogeneous terms suggesting the\nmatrix model loop equations for the RP2 resolvent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jun 2003 11:22:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Jun 2003 03:21:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 9 Jun 2003 12:53:23 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 3 Jul 2003 16:36:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We report on tests of redundant arrays of integrated drive\nelectronics (IDE) disk drives for use in offline high energy physics data\nanalysis. IDE redundant array of inexpensive disks (RAID) prices now are less\nthan the cost per terabyte of million-dollar tape robots! The arrays can be\nscaled to sizes affordable to institutions without robots and used when fast\nrandom access at low cost is important.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jun 2003 15:02:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

A total of ~ 10000\njobs consisting of two different computational types were submitted from four\ndifferent locations in Europe over a period of about one month. Nine sites were\nactive, providing integrated resources of more than 500 CPUs and about 5 TB of\ndisk space (with the additional use of two Mass Storage Systems). Descriptions\nof the adopted procedures, the problems encountered and the corresponding\nsolutions are reported.

We argue that the joint state of two synchronized microscopic clocks\nis always of this type when it is considered from the point of view of an\n``ignorant'' observer who is not synchronized with the other two parties.\n  We show that the entropy generation of a classical one-way synchronization\nprotocol is at least \\Delta S = \\hbar^2/(4\\Delta E \\Delta t)^2 if \\Delta t is\nthe time accuracy of the synchronism and \\Delta E is the energy bandwidth of\nthe clocks. This dissipation can only be avoided if the common time of the\nmicroscopic clocks is stored by an additional classical clock.\n  Furthermore, we give a similar bound on the entropy cost for resetting\nsynchronized clocks by a classical one-way protocol. The proof relies on\nobservations of Zurek on the thermodynamic relevance of quantum discord. We\nleave it as an open question whether classical multi-step protocols may perform\nbetter.\n  We discuss to what extent our results imply problems for classical concepts\nof reversible computation when the energy of timing signals is close to the\nHeisenberg limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jun 2003 18:27:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
