We investigate the dependence of the overall spectral\nmorphology of the maser emission and its variability on the luminosity of the\nYSO, and look for bursts and gradients in individual components. We find that\nhigher-luminosity sources tend to be associated with stronger and more stable\nmasers.Higher-luminosity YSOs can excite more emission components over a larger\nrange in velocity, yet the emission that dominates the spectra is at a velocity\nvery near that of the molecular cloud in which the objects are embedded. For\nLfir > 3E+04 Lo the maser emission becomes increasingly structured and more\nextended in velocity with increasing Lfir. Below this limit the maser emission\nshows the same variety of morphologies, but without a clear dependence on Lfir\nand with a smaller velocity extent. Also, for sources with Lfir above this\nlimit, the water maser is always present above the 5sigma-level; below it, the\ntypical 5sigma detection rate is 75-80%. We conclude that there must be a lower\nlimit to Lfir, below which the associated maser is below the detection level\nmost of the time. These results can be understood in terms of scaled versions\nof similar SFRs with different YSO luminosities, each with many potential sites\nof maser amplification, which can be excited provided there is sufficient\nenergy to pump them, i.e. the basic pumping process is identical regardless of\nthe YSO luminosity. In SFRs with lower input energies, the conditions of maser\namplification are much closer to the threshold conditions, and consequently\nmore unstable. We find indications that the properties of the maser emission\nmay be determined also by the geometry of the SFR, specifically by the beaming\nand collimation properties of the outflow driven by the YSO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jun 2003 13:37:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

It allows to break the\ndegeneracy of fundamental cosmological parameters one cannot obtain using only\nanisotropy data and provides new insight into conditions existing in the very\nearly Universe. Many experiments are now in progress whose aim is detecting\nanisotropy and polarization of the CMB. Measurements of the CMB polarization\nare however hampered by the presence of polarized foregrounds, above all the\nsynchrotron emission of our Galaxy, whose importance increases as frequency\ndecreases and dominates the polarized diffuse radiation at frequencies below\nabout 50 GHz. In the past the separation of CMB and synchrotron was made\ncombining observations of the same area of sky at different frequencies. In\nthis paper we show that the statistical properties of the polarized components\nof the synchrotron and dust foregrounds are different from the statistical\nproperties of the polarized component of the CMB, therefore one can build a\nstatistical estimator which allows to extract the polarized component of the\nCMB from single frequency data also when the polarized CMB signal is just a\nfraction of the total polarized signal.

In each\nof the three cases the particle produces a field that behaves as outgoing\nradiation in the wave zone, and therefore removes energy from the particle. In\nthe near zone the field acts on the particle and gives rise to a self-force\nthat prevents the particle from moving on a geodesic of the background\nspacetime. The field's action on the particle is difficult to calculate because\nof its singular nature: the field diverges at the position of the particle. But\nit is possible to isolate the field's singular part and show that it exerts no\nforce on the particle -- its only effect is to contribute to the particle's\ninertia. What remains after subtraction is a smooth field that is fully\nresponsible for the self-force. Because this field satisfies a homogeneous wave\nequation, it can be thought of as a free (radiative) field that interacts with\nthe particle; it is this interaction that gives rise to the self-force. The\nmathematical tools required to derive the equations of motion of a point scalar\ncharge, a point electric charge, and a point mass in a specified background\nspacetime are developed here from scratch.

If the structure group is compact, then a choice of an ad-invariant\ninner product on its Lie algebra gives naturally the structure of a Riemannian\nmanifold to the base. The integrability condition is then expressed in\ngeometric terms. In particular we get a relation to hyperbolic geometry if the\nstructure group is SU(2) or SO(3). The bundle of orthonormal frames of a\nhyperbolic oriented 3-manifold is naturally a complex manifold. If the base is\ngeodesically complete and connected, then we can endow the total space with a\nlocally free transitive holomorphic action of the complexified structure group.\nWe then get some restrictions for holomorphic maps from Riemann surfaces to the\ntotal space.
