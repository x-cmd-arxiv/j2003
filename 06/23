The photometry is the deepest to date for an isolated dwarf irregular\ngalaxy. The resulting color-magnitude diagram (CMD) is analyzed using three\ndifferent methods to derive a star formation history (SFH). All three find an\nenhanced star formation rate (SFR), from 3 to 6 Gyr ago, and similar\nage-metallicity relationships (AMR). A comparison of the newly observed outer\nfield with an earlier studied central field of IC 1613 shows that the SFR in\nthe outer field has been significantly depressed during the last Gyr. This\nimplies that the optical scale length of the galaxy has been decreasing with\ntime and that comparison of galaxies at intermediate redshift with present day\ngalaxies should take this effect into account. We find strong similarities\nbetween IC 1613 and the more distant Milky Way dSph companions in that all are\ndominated by star formation at intermediate ages. In particular, the SFH and\nAMR for IC 1613 and Leo I are indistinguishable. This implies that dIrr\ngalaxies cannot be distinguished from dSphs by their intermediate age stellar\npopulations. This type of a SFH may also be evidence for slower or suppressed\nearly star formation in dwarf galaxies due to photoionization after the\nreionization of the universe by background radiation. Assuming that IC 1613 is\ntypical of a dIrr evolving in isolation, since most of the star formation\noccurs at intermediate ages, these dwarf systems cannot be responsible for the\nfast chemical enrichment of the IGM which is seen at high redshift. There is no\nevidence for any large amplitude bursts of star formation in IC 1613, and we\nfind it highly unlikely that analogs of IC 1613 have contributed to the excess\nof faint blue galaxies in existing galaxy redshift surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jun 2003 11:20:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

In order to\naccurately measure the lifetime one needs to know the relationship between the\nbreak-up probability and lifetime to a 1% accuracy. We have obtained this\ndependence by modeling the evolution of pionic atoms in the target using Monte\nCarlo methods. The model relies on the computation of the pionium--target atom\ninteraction cross sections. Three different sets of pionium--target cross\nsections with varying degrees of complexity were used: from the simplest first\norder Born approximation involving only the electrostatic interaction to a more\nadvanced approach taking into account multi-photon exchanges and relativistic\neffects. We conclude that in order to obtain the pionium lifetime to 1%\naccuracy from the break-up probability, the pionium--target cross sections must\nbe known with the same accuracy for the low excited bound states of the pionic\natom.

This model is a generalization of the Fermi zero-range potential\nobtained by adding a non-trivial inner Hamiltonian and inner space with\nindefinite metric. We propose a general principle of analyticity of the\nCaley-transform of the S-scattering matrix, written as a function of wave\nnumber. This permits us to evaluate all parameters of the model, including the\nindefinite metric tensor of the inner space, once the spectrum of the inner\nHamiltonian, the scattering length and the effective radious are chosen.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jun 2003 02:26:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
