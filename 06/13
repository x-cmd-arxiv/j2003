In this study we investigate\nthe growth of eccentricities and inclinations of planetesimals in spatially\nhomogeneous protoplanetary disks using methods of kinetic theory. We explore\ndisks with a realistic mass spectrum of planetesimals evolving in time, similar\nto that obtained in self-consistent simulations of planetesimal coagulation. We\ncalculate the behavior of planetesimal random velocities as a function of the\nplanetesimal mass spectrum both analytically and numerically; results obtained\nby the two approaches agree quite well. Scaling of random velocity with mass\ncan always be represented as a combination of power laws corresponding to\ndifferent velocity regimes (shear- or dispersion-dominated) of planetesimal\ngravitational interactions. For different mass spectra we calculate\nanalytically the exponents and time dependent normalizations of these power\nlaws, as well as the positions of the transition regions between different\nregimes. It is shown that random energy equipartition between different\nplanetesimals can only be achieved in disks with very steep mass distributions\n(differential surface number density of planetesimals falling off steeper than\nm^{-4}), or in the runaway tails. In systems with shallow mass spectra\n(shallower than m^{-3}) random velocities of small planetesimals turn out to be\nindependent of their masses. We also discuss the damping effects of inelastic\ncollisions between planetesimals and of gas drag, and their importance in\nmodifying planetesimal random velocities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jun 2003 16:03:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

In\nthe unphysical regime, t<J, large superconducting susceptibilities are found,\nwhich moreover increase with decreasing temperatures, but for t>J, these\nsusceptibilities are small and decreasing with decreasing temperature; this\nsuggests that the t-J model does not support high-temperature\nsuperconductivity.

We\nrecalculate the series and give the replacement figures. In agreement with our\nearlier findings, we still find no evidence of any strong enhancement of the\nsuperconducting susceptibility with decreasing temperature.

The magnitude of this\neffect rises with energy and it may dramatically affect the normalization of\nthe RHIC data. We evaluate these corrections employing the light-cone dipole\nformalism and found a rather modest corrections for the current normalization\nof the d-Au data.
