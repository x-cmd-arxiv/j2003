Using a recent derivation of the Blazar radio LogN-LogS we calculate\nthat these sources induce an average sky brightness of 0.2 Jy/deg^2,\ncorresponding to an average temperature of ~3-5 muK. Moreover, we find that the\nassociated level of fluctuations is of the order of C_{l, Blazar}= 1.3 10^{-2}\nmu K^2 sr at 41 GHz.

Two peaks in the\nderivative of the resistive curves are identified as intra- and intergrain\nsuperconducting transitions. Strong intragrain granularity effects are\nobserved, and explained by considering the antiphase boundaries between\nstructural domains of coherently rotated RuO6 octahedra as intragrain\nJosephson-junctions. A different field dependence of the intragrain transition\ntemperature in these compounds was found. For Ru-(1212) it remains unchanged up\nto 0.1 T, decreasing for higher fields. In Ru-(1222) it smoothly diminishes\nwith the increase in field even for a value as low as 100 Oe. These results are\ninterpreted as a consequence of a spin-flop transition of the Ru moments. The\nlarge separation between the RuO2 layers in Ru-(1222) promotes a weak\ninterlayer coupling, leading the magnetic transition to occur at lower fields.\nThe suppression rate of the intragrain transition temperature is about five\ntimes higher for Ru-(1222), a result we relate to an enhancement of the 2D\ncharacter of the vortex structure.
