The initial statistics are lognormal in the\ngravitational potential field with positive (LNp) and negative (LNn) skewness;\nthe sign of the skewness is conserved by the density field, and the power\nspectrum is the same for all the simulations. Our aim is not to test a given\nnon-Gaussian statistics, but to explore the generic effect of positive- and\nnegative-skew statistics on halo properties. From our low-resolution\nsimulations, we find that LNp (LNn) halos are systematically more (less)\nconcentrated than their Gaussian counterparts. This result is confirmed by our\nMilky Way- and cluster-sized halos resimulated with high-resolution. In\naddition, they show inner density profiles that depend on the statistics: the\ninnermost slopes of LNp (LNn) halos are steeper (shallower) than those obtained\nfrom the corresponding Gaussian halos. A subhalo population embedded in LNp\nhalos is more susceptible to destruction than its counterpart inside Gaussian\nhalos. On the other hand, subhalos in LNn halos tend to survive longer than\nsubhalos in Gaussian halos. The spin parameter probability distribution of LNp\n(LNn) halos is skewed to smaller (larger) values with respect to the Gaussian\ncase. Our results show how the statistics of the primordial density field can\ninfluence some halo properties, opening this the possibility to constrain,\nalthough indirectly, the primordial statistics at small scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jun 2003 02:21:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Sep 2003 23:45:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The\nproperties of bremsstrahlung, the dominant emission process at these\nwavelengths, make it sensitive to structure and allow us to study how the\namount of structure changes in the wind by comparing the fluxes at different\nwavelengths. To look for variability, we acquired 3.6 and 6 cm observations\nwith the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA).

A\nsmooth wind model shows that the millimetre fluxes are too high compared to the\nradio fluxes. While recombination of helium in the outer wind cannot be\ndiscounted as an explanation, the wealth of evidence for structure strongly\nsuggests this as the explanation for the discrepancy. Model calculations show\nthat the structure needs to be present in the inner ~ 70 R* of the wind, but\nthat it decays significantly, or maybe even disappears, beyond that radius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jun 2003 14:22:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
