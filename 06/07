RTT150\nwas one of the first 1.5m-class telescopes pointed to the afterglow.\nObservations were started approximately 6 hours after the burst. During the\nfirst 5 hours of our observations the afterglow faded exactly as a power law\nwith index -1.19+-0.01 in each of the BVRI Bessel filters. After that, in all\nBVRI filters simultaneously we observe a steepening of the power law light\ncurve. The power law decay index smoothly approaches the value ~= -1.9,\nobserved by other observatories later. This power law break occurs at t-t_0\n=0.57 days and lasts for +-0.1 days. We observe no variability above the\ngradual fading with the upper limits 10--1% on time scales 0.1--1000s. Spectral\nflux distribution in four BVRI filters corresponds to the power law spectrum\nwith spectral index \\alpha=0.66+-0.01. The change of the power law decay index\nin the end of our observations can be interpreted as a signature of collimated\nultrarelativistic jet. The afterglow flux distribution in radio, optical and\nx-rays is consistent with synchrotron spectrum. We continue our observations of\nthis unique object with RTT150.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jun 2003 16:09:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Aug 2003 11:41:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We derive exact\ntime-dependent polarization for all spins in spin-1/2 ensemble with spatially\nindependent effective dipolar interactions. If the initial polarization is on a\nsingle (first) spin,$P_1(0)= 1$ then the exact spin dynamics of the model is\nshown to exhibit a periodical short pulses of the polarization of the first\nspin, the effect being typical of the systems having a large number, $N$, of\nspins.
