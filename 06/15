Systematic line shifts are\nuncovered and explained. In the Xe 5s and F 2s inner-valence regimes, from XeF2\nto XeF6, the usefulness of the one-particle picture of ionization is found to\nbecome progressively worse. Moreover, adding the electronegative fluorine\nligands seems to enhance--not suppress--the Auger decay of a Xe 4d core hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Jun 2003 14:21:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Dec 2003 17:27:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
