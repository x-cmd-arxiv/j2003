The idea is to start from a supersymmetric\nconfiguration with two parallel static Dp-branes, and slightly break the\nsupersymmetry conditions to produce a very flat potential for the field that\nparametrises the distance between the branes, i.e. the inflaton field. This\nbreaking can be achieved in various ways. I will describe one of the simplest\nexamples described in Ref. [1]: two almost parallel D4-branes in a flat\ncompactified space, with a small relative angle between the branes, softly\nbreaking supersymmetry. If the breaking parameter is sufficiently small, a\nlarge number of e-folds can be produced within the D-brane, for small changes\nof the configuration in the compactified directions. Such a process is local,\ni.e. it does not depend very strongly on the compactification space nor on the\ninitial conditions. Moreover, the breaking induces a very small velocity and\nacceleration, which ensures very small slow-roll parameters and thus an almost\nscale invariant spectrum of metric fluctuations, responsible for the observed\ntemperature and polarization anisotropies in the microwave background. Another\nprediction of the model is the small amplitude of the gravitational wave\nspectrum, which may not be detectable in the near future. Inflation ends as in\nhybrid inflation, triggered by the negative curvature of the string tachyon\npotential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jun 2003 09:51:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Yet, in order to utilise these theoretical advances, it\nis important to have appropriate proof techniques for the monodic fragment.\n  In this paper, we modify and extend the clausal temporal resolution\ntechnique, originally developed for propositional temporal logics, to enable\nits use in such monodic fragments. We develop a specific normal form for\nformulae in FOTL, and provide a complete resolution calculus for formulae in\nthis form. Not only is this clausal resolution technique useful as a practical\nproof technique for certain monodic classes, but the use of this approach\nprovides us with increased understanding of the monodic fragment. In\nparticular, we here show how several features of monodic FOTL are established\nas corollaries of the completeness result for the clausal temporal resolution\nmethod. These include definitions of new decidable monodic classes,\nsimplification of existing monodic classes by reductions, and completeness of\nclausal temporal resolution in the case of monodic logics with expanding\ndomains, a case with much significance in both theory and practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jun 2003 10:02:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The\nradiative correction calculations for polarization observables are somewhat\nmore complicated than those for rates. They tend to be smaller than those for\nthe rates. In most of the examples we discuss we include mass effects which\nsignificantly complicate the radiative correction calculations. We elaborate a\ngeneral scheme which allows one to enumerate the number of independent density\nmatrix elements in a reaction and provide explicit examples of angular decay\ndistributions in self--analyzing decays that allow one to experimentally\nmeasure the density matrix elements.

Nuclear reactions of this type represent\nintra-electronic processes, more precisely, the processes occurring inside the\narea of basic localization of electron. Distinctive characteristics of these\nprocesses are defined by interaction of the own field produced by electrically\ncharged matter of electron with free nuclei. Heavy nucleus, appearing inside\nthe area of basic localization of electron, is inevitably deformed because of\ninteraction of protons with the adjoining layers of electronic cloud, which may\ncause nuclear fission. If there occur \"inside\" electron two or greater number\nof light nuclei, an attractive force appears between the nuclei which may\nresult in the fusion of nuclei. The intra-electronic mechanism of nuclear\nreactions is of a universal character.

This conclusion\nstrictly follows from Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic field interacting\nwith electric charges and currents in vacuum, without resort to any additional\nhypotheses. That superluminal communication is possible is seen from the fact\nthat the own field, generated by particles and inseparable from them,\ntransforms the environment into a special physical medium which is capable to\ninstantaneously transfer a signal (information) about any changes, happening to\na particle in the region of its basic localization, to arbitrarily large\ndistances. The phenomenon of superluminal communication is caused by the\nnon-local connection of scalar and vector potentials with the electric and\nmagnetic field strengths.
