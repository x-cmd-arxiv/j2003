In\nthe case of AURIGA the dataflow is designed as a three tier: frontend, builder,\nconsumer. Each tier is represented by a set of agents possibly running on\ndifferent hosts. This system is well fit for projects on scales comparable to\nthe AURIGA experiment: permanent and temporary data storage is based on the\nFrame format adopted by the gravitational wave community, and the design is\nreliable and fault-tolerant for low rate systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 May 2003 20:49:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Jun 2003 20:44:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
