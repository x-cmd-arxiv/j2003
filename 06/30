It is\nimportant to emphasize that image subtraction can re-construct an un-biased\nframe to frame astrometric transform. A nearly optimal determination of this\nastrometric transform can be performed by expanding the spatial variations of\nthe kernel using the derivatives of the constant kernel solution.

We examine time-resolved X-ray, ultraviolet, optical, and\ninfrared data spanning the plateau phase of the outburst. We find that both\nX-ray and infrared bands show large amplitude variability. The ultraviolet and\noptical variability is more subdued, but clearly correlated with that seen in\nthe X-rays. The ultraviolet, at least, appears to be dominated by the\ncontinuum, although the lines are also variable. Using the X-ray variations as\na reference point, we find that the UV variability at long wavelengths occurs\nlater than that at short wavelengths. Uncertainty in HST timing prohibits a\ndetermination of the absolute lag with respect to the X-rays, however. The\ntransfer function is clearly not a delta-function, exhibiting significant\nrepeatable structure. For the main signal we can rule out an origin in\nreprocessing on the companion star - the lack of variation in the lags is not\nconsistent with this given a relatively high orbital inclination. Weak\nreprocessing from the disc and/or companion star may be present, but is not\nrequired, and another component must dominate the variability. This could be\nvariable synchrotron emission correlated with X-ray variability, consistent\nwith our earlier interpretation of the IR flux as due to synchrotron emission\nrather than thermal disc emission. In fact the broad-band energy distribution\nof the variability from IR to X-rays is consistent with expectations of\noptically thin synchrotron emission. We also follow the evolution of the\nlow-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation in X-rays, UV, and optical. Its\nproperties at all wavelengths are similar indicating a common origin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jun 2003 15:38:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The main aim of this study is to\npropose a methodology based both on concepts of nonlinear dynamics and on\ngeometric-topological invariants, for the characterization of attractors\nrelated to measurements based on the flame spontaneous light emission, like OH*\nradical, in order to classify different phases of the combustion process and to\nbetter recognize the transition mechanisms leading to the thermoacoustic\ninstabilities. Preliminary results, clearly show the powerfulness of the\napproach to show the dynamical evolution of the flame and to evidence the onset\nof the thermoacoustic instabilities: in particular the topological invariant\nindex (genus and related quantities) appear s as the best candidate for an\nearly indicator of the dynamical transition, characterized by the onset of a\nmore persistent, low entropy torus (quasi-periodic motion), as the related\nthermoacoustic attractor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jun 2003 12:52:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Therefore the geometric phases are\ndetermined by the metric. We construct a unitary map relating a given\ntime-independent Hilbert space to the time-dependent Hilbert space defined by a\npositive-definite dynamical invariant. This map defines a transformation that\nchanges the metric of the Hilbert space but leaves the Hamiltonian of the\nsystem invariant.

We studied\nanalytically dynamics of entangled states for two- and three-spin systems\ncoupled by the dipole-dipole interaction. In this case dynamics of the quantum\nentanglement is uniquely determined by the time evolution of MQ coherences of\nthe second order. The real part of the density matrix describing MQ dynamics in\nsolids is responsible for MQ coherences of the zeroth order while its imaginary\npart is responsible for the second order. Thus, one can conclude that dynamics\nof the entanglement is connected with transitions from the real part of the\ndensity matrix to the imaginary one and vice versa. A pure state which\ngeneralizes the GHZ and W states is found.
