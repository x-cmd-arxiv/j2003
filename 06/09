We construct\nthe Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis (CJT) effective potentials at finite temperature\nfor two types of pairing ansatz, namely the Color-Flavor locking (CFL) state\nand the two flavor superconducting (2SC) state. Strong coupling effects at low\ndensities, such as the off-Fermi surface and antiquarks contribution to the\npairing gap due to the large effective coupling, make the gap, critical\ntemperature and those ratio deviate from those weak coupling values.\nNevertheless, the ratio of the physical quantity for the CFL and that for the\n2SC does not differ so much from the weak coupling value, as long as the\npairing interaction is taken to be the same for the both cases. As a\nconsequence, the CFL state always dominates over 2SC state and the critical\ntemperatures to quark-gluon plasma (QGP) from both states coincides in the\nchiral limit. The energy gain in the CFL state relative to the 2SC state gets\nsmaller towards the critical line dividing (mu, T) plane into the QGP and CFL\nphases, and thus small perturbations can remove the degeneracy of these\ncritical lines.

Crucial points in both the current inflationary paradigm of the\nearly Universe and in some proposed alternatives are that, first, the\nperturbations are generated on microscopic scales as quantum vacuum\nfluctuations, and, second, that via an accelerated expansion of the background\ngeometry (or by a contraction of the background), the wavelengths of the\nfluctuations become much larger than the Hubble radius for a long period of\ncosmic evolution. Hence, both Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity are\nrequired in order to understand the generation and evolution of fluctuations.\n  After a review of the Newtonian theory of perturbations, I discuss first the\nclassical relativistic theory of fluctuations, and then their quantization.\nBriefly summarized are two new applications of the theory of cosmological\nfluctuations: the trans-Planckian ``problem'' of inflationary cosmology and the\nstudy of the back-reaction of cosmological fluctuations on the background\nspace-time geometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jun 2003 14:35:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

We show that by making one global choice, we can\ndetermine a cycle representative for the intersection of an equivariant Cartier\ndivisor with an invariant cycle on a toric variety. For a toric variety defined\nby a fan in N, the choice consists of giving an inner product or a complete\nflag for M_Q=Hom(N,Q), or more generally giving for each cone sigma in the fan\na linear subspace of M_Q complementary to the subspace of M_Q perpendicular to\nsigma, satisfying certain compatibility conditions.\n  We show that these intersection cycles have properties analogous to the usual\nintersections modulo rational equivalence. If X is simplicial (for instance, if\nX is non-singular), we obtain a commutative ring structure on the invariant\ncycles of X with rational coefficients. This ring structure determines cycles\nrepresenting certain characteristic classes of the toric variety. We also\ndiscuss how to define intersection cycles that require no choices, at the\nexpense of increasing the size of the coefficient field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jun 2003 01:38:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
