We first solve a general\nscalar $U(\\phib^2)$ field theory for $N$ large and discuss various\nnon-perturbative physical issues such as critical behaviour.

It is based on an extension of the theory of 't Hooft\nDeser and Jackew describing point particles in 3D gravity to four spacetime\ndimensions. General covariance now requires the basic excitations to be\nextended in one spatial dimension rather than pointlike. As a consequence the\nsymmetry of the Kodama state, which is the (anti)deSitter symmetry, is realized\n'holographically' on a timelike boundary, the generators of this symmetry being\nrelated to quasilocal energy-momenta. As GR induces a Chern-Simons theory on\nthe boundary, the deSitter symmetry of the vacuum must be q-deformed with the\ndeformation parameter related to the cosmological constant. It is proposed to\nintroduce excitations around this vacuum by putting punctures on the boundary\nto each of which is associate a vector in some representation of deSitter group\nprojected to the boundary. By equations of motion those punctures must be\nconnected by continuous lines of fluxes of an SO(3,1) gauge field.
