The case of a localized photocreated\nhole is studied and the calculations are performed with a Nozieres-De\nDominicis-like Hamiltonian. The hole potential is assumed to be small compared\nto the cyclotron energy and is therefore treated as a perturbation. Two\ncompeting many-body effects, the shakeup of the electron gas in the optical\ntransition, and the excitonic effect, contribute to the shakeup satellite\nintensities. It is shown, that the range of the hole potential essentially\ninfluences the shakeup spectrum. For a short range interaction the above\nmentioned competition is more important and results in the shakeup emission\nquenching when electrons occupy only the lowest Landau level. When more than\none Landau level is filled, the intensities of the shakeup satellites change\nwith magnetic field nonmonotonically. If the interaction is long range, the\nFermi sea shakeup processes dominate. Then, the satellite intensities smoothly\ndecrease when the magnetic field increases and there is no suppression of the\nshakeup spectrum when the only lowest Landau level is filled. It is shown also\nthat a strong hole localization is not a necessary condition for the SU\nspectrum to be observed.

The offline analysis has\ntwo steps: cluster finder and track finder. The results on how these algorithms\nare affected by the lossy compression are reported. In both compression\ntechnique entropy coding is applied to the set of events defined by the source\nmodel to reduce the bit rate to the corresponding source entropy. Using TPC\nsimulated data, the lossless and the lossy compression achieve a data reduction\nto 49.2% of the original data rate and respectively in the range of 35% down to\n30% depending on the desired precision.In this study we have focused on methods\nwhich are easy to implement in the frontend TPC electronics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2003 15:27:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The relationship between base and\nfiber i.e. the twisting of the bundle corresponds to the entanglement of the\nqubits. The measure of entanglement can be related to the length of the\nshortest geodesic with respect to the Mannoury-Fubini-Study metric on ${\\bf\nHP}^1$ between an arbitrary entangled state, and the separable state nearest to\nit. Using this result an interpretation of the standard Schmidt decomposition\nin geometric terms is given. Schmidt states are the nearest and furthest\nseparable ones lying on, or the ones obtained by parallel transport along the\ngeodesic passing through the entangled state. Some examples showing the\ncorrespondence between the anolonomy of the connection and entanglement via the\ngeometric phase is shown. Connections with important notions like the\nBures-metric, Uhlmann's connection, the hyperbolic structure for density\nmatrices and anholonomic quantum computation are also pointed out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2003 11:25:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
