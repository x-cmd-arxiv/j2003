In\nthis paper we examine the accuracy of the PSF anisotropy correction using\nimages of fields with a large number of stars. The ellipticity correlation\nfunction of the residuals is studied to quantify the effect of imperfect\ncorrections for PSF anisotropy on cosmic shear studies. These imperfections\noccur on the chip scale and consequently the systematic signal decreases\nrapidly with increasing angular scale. Separation of the signal into ``E''\n(curl-free) and ``B'' (curl) components can help to identify the presence of\nresidual systematics, but in general, the amplitude of the ``B''-mode is\ndifferent from that of the ``E''-mode. The study of fields with many stars can\nbe beneficial in finding a proper description of the variation of PSF\nanisotropy, and consequently help to significantly improve the accuracy with\nwhich the cosmic shear signal can be measured. We show that with such an\napproach it is feasible that the accuracy of future cosmic shear studies is\nlimited by the statistical noise introduced by the intrinsic shapes of the\nsources.

The coupling\ninteraction characterizing the chain rigidity and the effective on-site\npotentials are calculated for three main types of protein secondary structure.\nThe coupling interaction is found to be surprisingly weak for all of them but\ndifferent in character: repulsive for alpha-helix and anti-parallel beta-sheet\nstructures and attractive for parallel beta-sheet structure. The effective\non-site potential is found to be a hard one for alpha-helix and anti-parallel\nbeta-sheet and a soft one for parallel beta-sheet. In all three types of\nprotein secondary structures a stable zig-zag shape discrete breather (DB)\nassociated with the oscillations of torsional (dihedral) angles can exist due\nto weakness of the coupling interaction. However, since the absorption of far\ninfrared radiation (IR) by proteins is known to require the existence of rather\nlong chains of hydrogen bonds that takes place only in alpha-helicies, then one\ncan conclude that the excitation of a DB in such a way is possible in\nalpha-helix and seems to be hardly possible in beta-sheet structures.

First, we present a lower bound for the spin-1 XXZ chain in\nfinite volumes in terms of the gap of the two-site Hamiltonian.

Using\na contour expansion inspired by Kennedy, we show that the weights of contours\nsatisfy a condition of Kotecky and Preiss which allows us to express the free\nenergy of the system as a cluster expansion.

Initially, a\nchange in current on the boundary gives rise to a region of surface charge, the\nfield of which polarizes the near-wall layer with the thickness on the order of\none gyroradius of protons. The polarization process involves the formation of\nthe displacement current which produces the Ampere force accelerating the\nplasma inside the double layer.

The standard concept of a fluctuating electromagnetic field on such\nfrequencies meets difficulties when used as a model for the zero-point\noscillations or thermal photons in the thermal equilibrium inside metals.\nInstead, the surface impedance permits not to consider the electromagnetic\noscillations inside the metal but taking the realistic material properties into\naccount by means of the effective boundary condition. An independent derivation\nof the Lifshitz-type formulas for the Casimir free energy and force between two\nmetal plates is presented within the impedance approach. It is shown that they\nare free of the contradictions with thermodynamics which are specific to the\nusual Lifshitz formula for dielectrics in combination with the Drude model. We\ndemonstrate that in the impedance approach the zero-frequency contribution is\nuniquely fixed by the form of impedance function and does not need any of the\nad hoc prescriptions intensively discussed in the recent literature. As an\nexample, the computations of the Casimir free energy between two gold plates\nare performed at different separations and temperatures. It is argued that the\nsurface impedance approach lays a reliable framework for the future\nmeasurements of the thermal Casimir force.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jun 2003 15:52:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
