The emission is peaked\nin the cluster center and is detected out to 8' from the X-ray center. Fitting\na thermal model to the combined BeppoSax and PSPC spectra show excess emission\nbelow 1 keV in the PSPC and above 100 keV in the BeppoSax PDS. The source 26W20\nis in the field of view of the PDS. The addition of a powerlaw with the\nspectral parameters measured by Silverman et al. (1998) for 26W20 successfully\nmodels the hard component in the PDS. The remaining excess soft emission can be\nmodeled by either a low temperature, 0.75 - 1.03 keV component, or by a\npowerlaw with a steep spectral index, 2.3. Addition of a second thermal\ncomponent model provides a much better fit to the data than does the addition\nof a non-thermal component. The Chandra temperature map does not show any\nregion cooler than 6.9 keV within the region where the cool component was\ndetected. Simulations of the emission from embedded groups were performed and\ncompared with the Chandra temperature map which show groups are a plausible\nsource of ~1 keV emission. The cool component is centrally peaked in the\ncluster and the gas density and temperature are relatively high arguing against\nthe WHIM as the source of the X-ray emission. X-ray emission from elliptical\ngalaxies is not high enough to provide the total cool component luminosity,\n7.0x10^43 ergs s^-1. The peak of the cool component is located between the low\nfrequency radio halos arguing against a non-thermal interpretation for the\nemission. We conclude that emission from embedded groups is the most likely\norigin of the cool component in Abell 754.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2003 16:13:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We start by looking at the\nproperties of galaxies in the cores of rich clusters. We have focused on the\noverall picture: star formation in clusters is strongly suppressed relative to\nfield galaxies at the same redshift. We will argue that the increasing activity\nand blue populations of clusters with redshift results from a greater level of\nactivity in field galaxies rather than a change in the transformation imposed\nby the cluster environment. With this in mind, we travel out from the cluster\nfocussing firstly on the properties of galaxies in the outskirts of clusters\nand then on galaxies in isolated groups. At low redshift, we are able to\nefficiently probe these environments using the Sloan and 2DF redshift surveys.\nThese allow an accurate comparison of galaxy star formation rates in different\nregions. The current results show a strong suppression of star formation above\na critical threshold in local density. The threshold seems similar regardless\nof the overall mass of the system. At low redshift at least, only galaxies in\nclose, isolated pairs have their star formation rate boosted above the global\naverage. At higher redshift, work on constructing homogeneous catalogues of\ngalaxies in groups and in the infall regions of clusters is still at an early\nstage. In the final section, we draw these strands together, summarising what\nwe can deduce about the mechanisms that transform star forming field galaxies\ninto their quiescent cluster counter-parts.
