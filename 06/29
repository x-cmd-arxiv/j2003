In absence of long-range antiferromagnetic\norder, the spin system can reduce frustration, and also its free energy, by\nforming a state with an ordered orientation of the dipole moments, which leads\nto the appearance of spiral spin correlations. To investigate this model, a\nnon-linear sigma model is used in which disorder is introduced via a randomly\nfluctuating gauge field. A renormalization group study shows that the collinear\nfixed point of the model is destroyed through the disorder and that the\ndisorder coupling leads to an additive renormalization of the order parameter\nstiffness.
