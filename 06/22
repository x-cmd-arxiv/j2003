It is\nsuggested that annihilation of the alternating magnetic field at the pulsar\nwind termination shock provides the necessary mechanism. Toroidal stripes of\nopposite magnetic polarity are formed in the wind emanated from an obliquely\nrotating pulsar magnetosphere (the striped wind). At the termination shock, the\nflow is compressed and the magnetic field annihilates by driven reconnection.\nJump conditions are obtained for the shock in a striped wind. It is shown that\npostshock MHD parameters of the flow are the same as if the energy of\nalternating field has already been converted into the plasma energy upstream\nthe shock. Therefore the available estimates of the ratio of the Poynting flux\nto the matter energy flux, $\\sigma$, should be attributed not to the total\nupstream Poynting flux but only to that associated with the average magnetic\nfield.
