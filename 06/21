This process is called time delay interferometry (TDI). In\nthe papers that defined the TDI variables, their performance was evaluated in\nthe limit that the gravitational wave detector is fixed in space. However, the\nperformance depends on certain symmetries in the armlengths that are available\nif the detector is fixed in space, but that will be broken in the actual\nrotating and flexing configuration produced by the LISA orbits. In this paper\nwe investigate the performance of these TDI variables for the real LISA orbits.\nFirst, addressing the effects of rotation, we verify Daniel Shaddock's result\nthat the Sagnac variables will not cancel out the laser phase noise, and we\nalso find the same result for the symmetric Sagnac variable. The loss of the\nlatter variable would be particularly unfortunate since this variable also\ncancels out gravitational wave signal, allowing instrument noise in the\ndetector to be isolated and measured. Fortunately, we have found a set of more\ncomplicated TDI variables, which we call Delta-Sagnac variables, one of which\naccomplishes the same goal as the symmetric Sagnac variable to good accuracy.\nFinally, however, as we investigate the effects of the flexing of the detector\narms due to non-circular orbital motion, we show that all variables, including\nthe interferometer variables, which survive the rotation-induced loss of\ndirection symmetry, will not completely cancel laser phase noise when the\narmlengths are changing with time.

Although squeezing or entanglement may be helpful to improve the\nresistance to noise, they are not required for the protocols to remain secure\nwith high losses. Therefore, these protocols can be implemented very simply by\ntransmitting coherent states and performing homodyne detection. Here, we show\nthat entanglement nevertheless plays a crucial role in the security analysis of\ncoherent state protocols. Every cryptographic protocol based on displaced\ngaussian states turns out to be equivalent to an entanglement-based protocol,\neven though no entanglement is actually present. This equivalence even holds in\nthe absence of squeezing, for coherent state protocols. This ``virtual''\nentanglement is important to assess the security of these protocols as it\nprovides an upper bound on the mutual information between Alice and Bob if they\nhad used entanglement. The resulting security criteria are compared to the\nseparability criterion for bipartite gaussian variables. It appears that the\nsecurity thresholds are well within the entanglement region. This supports the\nidea that coherent state quantum cryptography may be unconditionally secure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jun 2003 21:38:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}

That is, variables have a definite\nstatus for all time and a measurement only tells us which value it had.\nHowever, at present modal dynamics are only applicable to situations that are\ndescribed in the orthodox theory by projective measures. In this paper we\nextend modal dynamics to include positive operator measures (POMs). That is,\nfor example, rather than using a complete set of orthogonal projectors, we can\nuse an overcomplete set of nonorthogonal projectors. We derive the conditions\nunder which Bell's stochastic modal dynamics for projective measures reduce to\ndeterministic dynamics, showing (incidentally) that Brown and Hiley's\ngeneralization of Bohmian mechanics [quant-ph/0005026, (2000)] cannot be thus\nderived. We then show how {\\em deterministic} dynamics for positive operators\ncan also be derived. As a simple case, we consider a Harmonic oscillator, and\nthe overcomplete set of coherent state projectors (i.e. the Husimi POM). We\nshow that the modal dynamics for this POM in the classical limit correspond to\nthe classical dynamics, even for the nonclassical number state $\\ket{n}$. This\nis in contrast to the Bohmian dynamics, which for energy eigenstates, the\ndynamics are always non-classical.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Jun 2003 01:56:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2004 01:56:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2007 21:40:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
