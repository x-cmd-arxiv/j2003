This is the first time that this quasar is observed in the hard\nX-ray range (above 2 keV). We find that Q0056-363 is a powerful X-ray quasar,\nwith a 0.3-12 keV unabsorbed luminosity of about 1.2 x 10^45 erg s-1 with the\nlargest part (~67%) emitted below 2 keV. The spectrum reveals a large\nfeatureless soft X-ray excess below 2 keV and a strong broad FeKalpha line at\n6.4 keV (in the quasar frame). The FeK alpha line is due to low to moderate\nionization states of iron (i.e., < Fe XVII), with an equivalent width of about\n250 eV and a velocity width of about 25,000 km s-1. Q0056-363 is presently the\nmost luminous AGN known to exhibit such a broad and intense FeKalpha line\nprofile from near neutral iron. The line can be fitted with a relativistic\nprofile from an accretion disc around either a Schwarzschild (non-rotating) or\na Kerr (rotating) black hole. A combination of two thermal Comptonization\ncomponents and a disc reflection model is favored to explain both the continuum\nover the energy range 0.3-12 keV and the FeK alpha line. A patchy corona\ncovering a large part of the inner disc surface is needed in order to be\ncompatible with the accretion rate inferred from the spectral energy\ndistribution of Q0056-363, unless the mass of the black hole is much higher\nthan about 5 x 10^8 M_odot.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jun 2003 16:51:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The spatial resolution of these FIR maps allows the separation\nof spiral arms and interarm regions and the isolation of a large number of\nstar-forming regions. The spectral energy distribution in the FIR indicates a\nsuperposition of two components, a warm one originating from dust at ~45K, and\na cold one, at ~16K. The warm component is concentrated towards the spiral arms\nand the star-forming regions, and is likely heated by the UV radiation from OB\nstars. The cold component is more smoothly distributed over the disk, and\nheated by the diffuse interstellar radiation. For the about 60 star-forming\nregions detected the H-alpha/FIR flux ratio increases significantly with the\ndistance from the galaxy center, probably due to decreasing extinction.

We find\nthat a cold gas disc forming in an ambient hot gas halo receives a strong\nhydrodynamic torque from the hot gas. By splitting the hydrodynamic force into\nartificial viscosity and pressure gradients, we find that the angular momentum\ntransport is caused not by the artificial viscosity but by the pressure\ngradients. Using simple test simulations of shear flows, we conclude that the\npressure gradient-based viscosity can be divided into two components: one due\nto the noisiness of SPH and the other to ram pressure. The former is\nproblematic even with very high resolution because increasing resolution does\nnot reduce the noisiness. On the other hand, the ram pressure effect appears\nonly when a cold gas disc or sheet does not contain enough particles. In such a\ncase, holes form in the disc or sheet, and then ram pressure from intra-hole\nhot gas, causes significant deceleration. In simulations of galactic disc\nformation, star formation usually decreases the number of cold gas particles,\nand hole formation leads to the fragmentation of the disc. To circumvent these\nproblem, we modify the SPH algorithm, decoupling the cold from the hot gas\nphases, i.e. inhibiting the hydrodynamic interaction between cold and hot\nparticles. This, a crude modelling of a multi-phase fluid in SPH cosmological\nsimulations, leads to the formation of smooth extended cold gas discs and to\nbetter numerical convergence.

It is thus important to critically examine this measurement. By\nanalysing the velocity widths of the DI, HI and metal lines present in this\nsystem, Kirkman et al. (2001) report that the additional absorption in the blue\nwing of the lya line can not be DI, with a confidence level of 98%. Here we\npresent a more detailed analysis, taking into account possible wavelength\nshifts between the three sets of HST spectra used in the analysis. We find that\nthe constraints on this system are not as strong as those claimed by Kirkman et\nal. The discrepancy between the parameters of the blue wing absorption and the\nparameters expected for DI is marginally worse than 1 sigma.\n  Tytler et al.(1999) commented on the first analysis of Webb et\nal.(1997,1998), reporting the presence of a contaminating lower redshift Lyman\nlimit system, with log[N(HI)] = 16.7 at z=0.602, which biases the N(HI)\nestimate for the main system. Here we show that this absorber actually has\nlog[N(HI)] < 14.6 and does not impact on the estimate of N(HI) in the system of\ninterest at z = 0.701.\n  The purpose of the present paper is to highlight important aspects of the\nanalysis which were not explored in previous studies, and hence help refine the\nmethods used in future analyses of D/H in quasar spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jun 2003 07:33:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Qualitative agreement\nwith the experimental results with respect to the magnitude and sign of this\nasymmetry is obtained. On the basis of the NEGF-HF calculation, the origin of\nthe effect is suggested to be the asymmetric behavior of the character of the\njunction highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) at opposite biases. This\nchange of character leads to different effective barriers for electron transfer\nfor opposite signs of the voltage drop across the junction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jun 2003 11:28:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In this model, the general form of the susceptibility\nand group velocity of the probe laser we obtained are operators. Their\nexpectation value and fluctuation can be obtained on the Fock space.\nFurthermore the uncertainty of the group velocity under very weak intensity of\nthe controlling laser and the uncertainty relation between the phase operator\nof coupling laser and the group velocity are approximately given. Considering\nthe decay rates of various levels, we may analyze the probe laser near\nresonance in detail and calculate the fluctuation in both absorption and\ndispersion. We also discuss how the fully quantized model reduces to a\nsemiclassical model when the mean photon numbers of the coupling laser is\ngetting large.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jun 2003 08:43:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

With an\nadiabatically coherence manipulation for the atom-field couplings by stimulated\nRamann scattering, the dark states will extrapolate from an exciton state of an\nensemble to that of another.

The $q$-entropies depend on the density\nmatrix $\\rho$ through the quantity $\\omega_q = Tr\\rho^q$, and admit as a\nparticular instance the standard von Neumann entropy in the limit case $q\\to\n1$. A comprehensive numerical survey of the space of pure and mixed states of\nbipartite systems is here performed, in order to determine the volumes in state\nspace occupied by those states exhibiting various special properties related to\nthe signs of their conditional $q$-entropies and to their connections with\nother separability-related features, including the majorization condition.\nDifferent values of the entropic parameter $q$ are considered, as well as\ndifferent values of the dimensions $N_1$ and $N_2$ of the Hilbert spaces\nassociated with the constituting subsystems. Special emphasis is paid to the\nanalysis of the monotonicity properties, both as a function of $q$ and as a\nfunction of $N_1$ and $N_2$, of the various entropic functionals considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jun 2003 15:17:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
