(2) The interpretation of the burst structure (IBS) paradigm\ndifferentiates in all GRBs between an injector phase and a beam-target phase.\n(3) The GRB-supernova time sequence (GSTS) paradigm introduces the concept of\ninduced supernova explosion in the supernovae-GRB association. These three\nparadigms are illustrated using our theory based on the vacuum polarization\nprocess occurring around an electromagnetic black hole (EMBH theory) and using\nGRB 991216 as a prototype.

We then study the approach of the PEMB pulse to transparency, the\nemission of the proper GRB (P-GRB) and its relation to the ``short GRBs''.\nFinally the three different regimes of the afterglow are described within the\nfully radiative and radial approximations. The best fit of the theory leads to\nan unequivocal identification of the ``long GRBs'' as extended emission\noccurring at the afterglow peak (E-APE).

This approach helps us to define independence of events\nand differently from the situation in the classical theory of probability, if\nan event $a$ is independent of an event $b$, then the event $b$ can be\ndependent on the event $a$. We will show that we can define a $s$-map (function\nfor simultaneous measurements on a quantum logic). It can be shown that if we\nhave the conditional state we can define the $s$-map and conversely.
