On the\nother hand, at very low driving velocity ($V<1 \\mu m/s$), we evidence a\ndiscontinuous and hysteretic transition to a stick-slip regime characterized by\na strong divergence of the maximal blockage force when the velocity goes to\nzero. We show that all this phenomenology is strongly influenced by surrounding\nhumidity. We also present a tentative to establish a link between the granular\nrheology and the solid friction forces between the wall and the grains. We base\nour discussions on a simple theoretical model and independent grain/wall\ntribology measurements. We also use finite elements numerical simulations to\nconfront experimental results to isotropic elasticity. A second system made of\npolydisperse assemblies of glass beads is investigated. We emphasize the onset\nof a new dynamical behavior, i.e. the large distribution of blockage forces\nevidenced in the stick-slip regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Feb 2003 16:03:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-16"}

The heat generated by viscous friction produces\na local temperature increase near the tube walls with a consequent decrease of\nthe viscosity which may dramatically change the temperature and velocity\nprofiles. These processes are mainly controlled by the Pecl\\'et number, the\nNahme number, the flow rate and the thermal boundary conditions. The problem of\nviscous heating in fluids was investigated in the past for its practical\ninterest in the polymer industry, and was invoked to explain some rheological\nbehaviours of silicate melts, but was not completely applied to study magma\nflows. In this paper we focus on the thermal and mechanical effects caused by\nviscous heating in tubes of finite lengths. We find that in magma flows at high\nNahme number and typical flow rates, viscous heating is responsible for the\nevolution from Poiseuille flow, with a uniform temperature distribution at the\ninlet, to a plug flow with a hotter layer near the walls. When the temperature\ngradients induced by viscous heating are very pronounced, local instabilities\nmay occur and the triggering of secondary flows is possible. For completeness,\nthis paper also describes magma flow in infinitely long tubes both at steady\nstate and in transient phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Feb 2003 14:17:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Dec 2003 13:13:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}
