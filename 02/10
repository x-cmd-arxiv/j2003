These can be\nproduced prior to big bang nucleosynthesis by the Z' interactions, leading to a\nfaster expansion rate and too much ^4He. We quantify the constraints on the Z'\nproperties from nucleosynthesis for Z' couplings motivated by a class of E_6\nmodels parametrized by an angle theta_E6. The rate for the annihilation of\nthree approximately massless right-handed neutrinos into other particle pairs\nthrough the Z' channel is calculated. The decoupling temperature, which is\nhigher than that of ordinary left-handed neutrinos due to the large Z' mass, is\nevaluated, and the equivalent number of new doublet neutrinos Delta N_nu is\nobtained numerically as a function of the Z' mass and couplings for a variety\nof assumptions concerning the Z-Z' mixing angle and the quark-hadron transition\ntemperature T_c.

This framework provides a powerful tool for\nassessing the capabilities and limitations of performing quantum information\nprocessing tasks using current experimental techniques. The Gottesman-Knill\ntheorem is generalized to the infinite-dimensional representations of the group\nstabilizer formalism and further generalized to include non-invertable\nsemigroup transformations, providing a theorem for the efficient classical\nsimulation of operations within this framework. As a result, we place powerful\nconstraints on obtaining computational speedups using current techniques in\nquantum optics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Feb 2003 07:07:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

For n=2 it is a set\nwith six projectors associated with eigenvectors of three Pauli matrices, but\nfor n>2 the construction produces not such a `regular' set. In this paper are\nrevisited some results of previous work [quant-ph/0104126] and discussed\nanother, more symmetric construction with the Weyl matrix pair (as the\ngeneralization of Pauli matrices).

We provide an elementary derivation of the passage\ntime, and demonstrate that the known lower bound, due to Fleming, is typically\nattained, except for special cases in which the energy spectra have\nparticularly simple structures. It is also shown, using a geodesic argument,\nthat the passage times for these exceptional cases are necessarily larger than\nthe Fleming bound.
