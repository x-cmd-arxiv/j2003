We detected the CO rotational lines from\nJup = 15 to Jup = 45. While the lines with Jup<= 32 are spectrally unresolved,\nthe higher lying lines show a broadened profile. Finally, we detected two 13CO\nlines, namely at Jup = 18 and 24, from which we could derive the opacities of\nthe relative 12CO lines. The LVG analysis of the observed line spectrum allows\nto distinguish three main physical components with different temperatures,\ndensities and column densities: 1) lines with Jup< 20 originate mainly in the\ndiffuse photodissociation region surrounding the source; 2) lines with Jup\nbetween 20 and 30 originate in the high velocity outflow (plateau) emanating\nfrom IrC2; 3) lines with Jup > 32 originate in the hot and dense gas of the\nshocked component of the outflow.
