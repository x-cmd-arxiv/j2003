The luminosity of the galaxy's X-ray halo\nis found to compare favourably with the observationally determined correlation\nwith optical blue band luminosity (L_X:L_B) relation. Factors affecting the\nX-ray luminosity are explored and it is found that the gas injection rate is a\ndominant factor in determining the integrated luminosity. Observational\nproperties of the material stripped from the galaxy, which forms an X-ray wake,\nare investigated and it is found that wakes are most visible around galaxies\nwith a substantial initial gas content, during their first passage though the\ncluster. We define a statistical skewness measure which may be used to\ndetermine the direction of motion of a galaxy using X-ray observations.\nStructures formed in these simulations are similar to the cold fronts seen in\nobservation of cluster mergers where a sharp increase in surface brightness is\naccompanied by a transition to a cooler region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2003 12:18:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We calculate and illustrate graphically populations of the collective\natomic states and the Wootters entanglement measure (concurrence) for two sets\nof initial atomic conditions. Our calculations include the dipole-dipole\ninteraction and a spatial separation between the atoms that the antisymmetric\nstate of the system is included throughout even for small interatomic\nseparations. It is shown that spontaneous emission can lead to a transient\nentanglement between the atoms even if the atoms were prepared initially in an\nunentangled state. We find that the ability of spontaneous emission to create\nthe transient entanglement relies on the absence of population in the\ncollective symmetric state of the system. For the initial state of only one\natom excited, the entanglement builds up rapidly in time and reaches a maximum\nfor the parameter values corresponding roughly to zero population in the\nsymmetric state. On the other hand, for the initial condition of both atoms\nexcited, the atoms remain unentangled until the symmetric state is depopulated.\nA simple physical interpretation of these results is given in terms of the\ndiagonal states of the density matrix of the system. We also study entanglement\ncreation in a system of two non-identical atoms of different transition\nfrequencies. It is found that the entanglement between the atoms can be\nenhanced compared to that for identical atoms, and can decay with two different\ntime scales resulting from the coherent transfer of the population from the\nsymmetric to the antisymmetric state. In addition, we find that a decaying\ninitial entanglement between the atoms can display a revival behaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2003 02:04:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
