Since the supernova rate is a direct measure for the production rate\nof cosmic rays we conclude that very young galaxies must be strong sources of\ncosmic rays. The key argument of our model is the finding that magnetic fields\nand cosmic rays are dynamically coupled, i.e. a strong cosmic ray source\ncontains strong magnetic fields since the relativistic particles drive an\nefficient dynamo in a galaxy via their buoyancy. We construct a\nphenomenological model of a dynamo driven by buoyancy of cosmic rays and show\nthat if azimuthal shearing is strong enough the dynamo amplification timescale\nis close to the buoyancy timescale of the order of several $10^7 \\div 10^8$ yr.\nWe predict that young galaxies are strongly magnetized and may contribute\nsignificantly to the gamma-ray-background.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Feb 2003 20:27:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We detected coherent\npulsations from 17 sources. Among them, eight were newly discovered during this\nstudy.

We detected X-ray emission from eight supernova remnants\n(SNRs). Among them, five SNRs showed emission lines in their spectra, hence we\nregarded the five as thermal SNRs. We found that XBPs and thermal SNRs in the\nSMC can be clearly separated by their spectral hardness ratio. Applying this\nempirical law to faint (thus unclassified) sources, we found 19 XBP candidates\nand four thermal SNR candidates. We also found several tens of candidates for\nactive galactic nuclei, both from the hardness ratio and the logN--logS\nrelation of extragalactic sources. Based on these ASCA results and further\ninformation from other sattelites, we compiled comprehensive catalogues of\ndiscrete X-ray sources in the Small Magellanic Cloud. Using the catalogues, we\nderived the spatial distributions of XBPs and SNRs. XBPs and SNRs were found to\nbe concentrated in the main body and eastern wing, which resembles the\ndistribution of young stars with ages of ~2e7yr. By comparing the source\npopulations in the SMC and our Galaxy, we suggest that the star-forming rate\n(per unit mass) in the SMC was much higher than the Galaxy 1e7yr ago.

No other OH/IR star is known to have\ncrystalline silicate features in absorption up to these wavelengths. This\nsuggests that IRAS 16342-3814 must have, or recently had, an extremely high\nmass-loss rate.

The 3.8 um ISAAC image shows\na bipolar reflection nebula with a dark equatorial waist or torus, similar to\nthat seen in optical Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images. The position angle of\nthe nebula decreases significantly with increasing wavelength, suggesting that\nthe dominant source of emission changes from scattering to thermal emission.\nStill, even up to 20 um the nebula is oriented approximately along the major\naxis of the nebula seen in the HST and ISAAC images, suggesting that the torus\nmust be very cold, in agreement with the very red ISO spectrum. The 20 um image\nshows a roughly spherically symmetric extended halo, approximately 6'' in\ndiameter, which is probably due to a previous phase of mass-loss on the AGB,\nsuggesting a transition from a (more) spherically symmetric to a (more) axial\nsymmetric form of mass-loss at the end of the AGB.

In this letter, we establish\nphysical limits on how closely can a quantum mechanical system be steered to a\ndesired target state in the presence of relaxation. In particular, we\nexplicitly compute the maximum coherence or polarization that can be\ntransferred between coupled nuclear spins in the presence of very general\ndecoherence mechanisms that include cross-correlated relaxation. We give\nanalytical expressions for the control laws (pulse sequences) which achieve\nthese physical limits and provide supporting experimental evidence.\nExploitation of cross-correlation effects has recently led to the development\nof powerful methods in NMR spectroscopy to study very large biomolecules in\nsolution. We demonstrate with experiments that the optimal pulse sequences\nprovide significant gains over these state of the art methods, opening new\navenues for spectroscopy of much larger proteins. Surprisingly, in spite of\nvery large relaxation rates, optimal control can transfer coherence without any\nloss when cross-correlated relaxation rates are tuned to auto-correlated\nrelaxation rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Feb 2003 18:50:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
