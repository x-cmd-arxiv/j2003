We detected about 60 maser features at each\nepoch. Overall, 61 features, detected at least twice, were tracked by their\nradial velocities and proper motions. The 3-D maser kinematics exhibited a\ncircumstellar envelope that is expanding roughly spherically with a velocity of\nabout 8 km/s. Asymmetries in both the spatial and velocity distributions of the\nmaser features were found in the envelope, but less significant than that found\nin other semiregular variables. Systematic radial-velocity drifts of individual\nmaser features were found with amplitudes of <= 2 km/s/yr. For one maser\nfeature, we found a quadratic position shift with time along a straight line on\nthe sky. This apparent motion indicates an acceleration with an amplitude of 33\nkm/s/yr, implying the passage of a shock wave driven by the stellar pulsation\nof RT Vir. The acceleration motion is likely seen only on the sky plane because\nof a large velocity gradient formed in the accelerating maser region.

With recent observational progress with the\nadvent of 8m-class telescopes and efficient spectrographs, the dominant source\nof uncertainty today originates with the assumptions and approximations in the\nanalyses, emphasizing the great need for continuing efforts in improving the\nrealism of stellar atmosphere modelling. In the present contribution I will\ndescribe recent progress in this regard by focussing on three complementary\ntypes of model atmospheres: line-blanketed non-LTE models of hot stars, 3D\nhydrodynamical models of cool stars and semi-empirical models for large-scale\nstellar abundance analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2003 06:34:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

When a black hole has a\nsuper-Eddington accretion rate, the empirical relation of reverberation mapping\nhas two possible ways. First, it reduces to a relation between the black hole\nmass and the size of the broad line region due to the photon trapping effects\ninside the accretion disk. For the Kaspi et al.'s empirical reverberation\nrelation, we get the limit relation as $M_{\\rm BH}=(2.9 - 12.6)\\times\n10^6M_{\\odot} (\\upsilon_{\\rm FWHM}/10^3{\\rm km s^{-1}})^{6.67}$, called as the\nEddington limit. Second, the Eddington limit luminosity will be relaxed if the\ntrapped photons can escape from the magnetized super-Eddington accretion disk\nvia the photon bubble instability, and the size of the broad line region will\nbe enlarged according to the empirical reverberation relation, leading to a\nrelatively narrow width of H$\\beta$. We call this the Begelman limit.\n  Super-Eddington accretions in a sample composed of 164 AGNs have been\nsearched by this limit relation. We find there are a handful of objects locate\nbetween the Eddington and Begelman limit lines, they may be candidates of\nsuper-Eddington accretors in a hybrid structure of photon trapping and photon\nbubble instability.

Numerical calculations show that for the anti-parallel\nalignment, a single Kondo peak always appears in the equilibrium DOS, resulting\nin the conventional temperature behavior in the linear conductance and the\nzero-bias maximum in the differential conductance. The strength of the DOS peak\nis gradually suppressed with increasing polarization, due to the fact that\nformation of the Kondo-correlated state is more difficult in the presence of\nhigher polarization. On the contrary, for the parallel configuration the Kondo\npeak in the DOS descends precipitately and splits into two peaks to form a very\nsteep valley between them. This splitting contributes to the appearance of a\n\"hump\" in the temperature-dependent linear conductance and a nonzero-bias\nmaximum in the differential conductance.

This study is based on an exact treatment of finite in-medium path\nlength, it includes the case of a dynamically expanding medium, and it extends\nto the angular dependence of the medium-induced gluon radiation pattern. All\ncalculations are done in the multiple soft scattering approximation\n(Baier-Dokshitzer-Mueller-Peign\\'e-Schiff--Zakharov ``BDMPS-Z''-formalism) and\nin the single hard scattering approximation (N=1 opacity approximation). By\ncomparison, we establish a simple relation between transport coefficient, Debye\nscreening mass and opacity, for which both approximations lead to comparable\nresults. Together with this paper, a CPU-inexpensive numerical subroutine for\ncalculating quenching weights is provided electronically. To illustrate its\napplications, we discuss the suppression of hadronic transverse momentum\nspectra in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Remarkably, the kinematic constraint\nresulting from finite in-medium path length reduces significantly the\ntransverse momentum dependence of the nuclear modification factor, thus leading\nto consistency with the data measured at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider\n(RHIC).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2003 12:14:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Due to the imaginary-time periodicity of the interaction under X^0\n-> X^0 + 2 pi i, these configurations have intriguing similarities to black\nhole or de Sitter geometries. For example, the open string pair production as\nseen by an Unruh detector is thermal at temperature T = 1/4 pi. It is shown\nthat, despite the rapid time dependence of the s-brane, there exists an exactly\nthermal mixed state of open strings. The corresponding boundary state is\nconstructed for both the bosonic and superstring cases. This state defines a\nlong-distance Euclidean effective field theory whose light modes are confined\nto the s-brane. At the critical value of the coupling lambda=1/2, the boundary\ninteraction simply generates an SU(2) rotation by pi from Neumman to Dirichlet\nboundary conditions. The lambda=1/2 s-brane reduces to an array of sD-branes\n(D-branes with a transverse time dimension) on the imaginary time axis. The\nlong range force between a (bosonic) sD-brane and an ordinary D-brane is shown\nfrom the annulus diagram to be 11/12 times the force between two D-branes.

In particular, a result of this type is proved in [BLS].The\nformula proved in that paper turns out to be equivalent to saying that the\nlocal Euler obstruction, as a constructible function, satisfies the local Euler\ncondition (in bivariant theory) with respect to general linear forms.\n  The purpose of this work is to understand what prevents the local Euler\nobstruction of satisfying the local Euler condition with respect to functions\nwhich are singular at the considered point. This is measured by an invariant\n(or ``defect'') of such functions that we define below. We give an\ninterpretation of this defect in terms of vanishing cycles, which allows us to\ncalculate it algebraically. When the function has an isolated singularity, our\ninvariant can be defined geometrically, via obstruction theory. We notice that\nthis invariant unifies the usual concepts of {\\it the Milnor number} of a\nfunction and of the {\\it local Euler obstruction} of an analytic set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2003 18:52:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The ensemble quantum computation for the\nprime factorization is based on the basic principle that both a closed quantum\nsystem and its ensemble obey the same unitary dynamics of quantum mechanics if\nthere is not any decoherence effect in both the quantum system and its\nensemble. It uses the NMR multiple-quantum measurement techniques to output the\nquantum computational results that are the inphase multiple-quantum spectra of\nthe spin ensemble. It has been shown that the inphase NMR multiple-quantum\nspectral intensities used to search for the period of the modular exponential\nfunction may reduce merely in a polynomial form as the qubit number of the spin\nensemble. The time evolution process of the modular exponential operation on\nthe quantum computer obeys the unitary dynamics of quantum mechanics and hence\nthe computational output is governed by the quantum dynamics. This essential\ndifference between the quantum computer and the classical one could be the key\npoint for the quantum computation outperforming the classical one in the prime\nfactorization on a spin ensemble without any quantum entanglement. It has been\nshown that the prime factorization based on the quantum dynamics on a spin\nensemble is locally efficient at least.
