Assuming the microcanonical definition of entropy, we\nexamine the local entropy per particle produced between the ``freeze out'' era\nto the present. An ``entropy consistency'' criterion emerges by comparing this\nentropy with the entropy per particle of actual galactic structures given in\nterms of dynamical halo variables. We apply this criterion to the cases when\nneutralinos are mosly b-inos and mostly higgsinos, in conjunction with the\nusual ``abundance'' criterion requiring that present neutralino relic density\ncomplies with $0.1 < \\Omega_{\\chic{\\tilde\\chi^0_1}} < 0.3$ for $h\\simeq 0.65$.\nThe joint application of both criteria reveals that a better fitting occurs for\nthe b-ino channels, hence the latter seem to be favoured over the higgsino\nchannels. The suggested methodology can be applied to test other annihilation\nchannels of the neutralino, as well as other particle candidates of thermal\ngases relics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 2003 23:07:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}

Dense baryonic matter is described as the ground state of a\nskyrmion matter which appears in two differentiated phases as a function of\nmatter density: i) at high densities as a stable cubic-centered (CC)\nhalf-skyrmion crystal; ii) at low densities as an unstable face-centered cubic\n(FCC) skyrmion crystal. We substitute the latter by a stable inhomogeneous\nphase of lumps of dense matter, which represents a naive Maxwell construction\nof the phase transition. This baryonic dense medium serves as a background for\nthe pions whose effective {\\em in-medium} Lagrangian we construct by allowing\ntime-dependent quantum fluctuations on the classical dense matter field. We\nfind that the same parameter which describes the phase transition for baryonic\nmatter, the expectation value of the $\\sigma$ field, also describes the phase\ntransition for the dynamics of the {\\em in-medium} pion. Thus, the structure of\nthe baryonic ground state $crucially$ determines the behavior of the pion in\nthe medium. As matter density increases, $<\\sigma>$ decreases, a phenomenon\nwhich we interpret to signal, in terms of the parameters of the effective pion\nLagrangian $f_\\pi^*$ and $m_\\pi^*$, the restoration of chiral symmetry at high\ndensity.

We have found that the\nalgorithm exhibits linear convergence for general mixed states, and that it\ncorrectly reproduces the known results for pairs of qubits and for isotropic\nstates. The results of an example application of the code are discussed:\ncalculating the entanglement of formation of a Psi+ Bell state of two qutrits\nwhen one of those qutrits is subject to various decoherence channels. The\nresults for qutrits are contrasted with those for qubits: for the types of\ndecoherence considered here, qutrit entanglement appears to be more robust than\nqubit entanglement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 2003 17:51:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Feb 2003 15:17:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

As a direct application of such quantization rules, we quantize a\nclassically time evolved function\n  $\\mathcal{O}(q,p,t)$, and calculate its expectation value in coherent states.\nThe result can be expressed in terms of the application of a classical operator\nwhich performs a {\\em Gaussian smoothing} of the original function\n$\\mathcal{O}$ evaluated at the center of the coherent state. This scheme\nproduces a natural semi-classical expansion for the quantum expectation values\nat a short time scale. Moreover, since the classical Liouville evolution of a\nGaussian probability density gives the {\\bf same} form for the classical\nstatistical mean value, we can calculate the first order correction in $\\hbar$\nentirely from the associated classical time evolved function. This allows us to\nwrite a general expression for the Ehrenfest time in terms of the departure of\nthe centroid of the quantum distribution from the classical trajectory provided\nwe start with an initially coherent state for each subsystem. In order to\nillustrate this approach, we have calculated analytically the Ehrenfest time of\na model with $N$ coupled non-linear oscillators with non-linearity of even\norder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 2003 18:22:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}

Such opportunities become feasible through\nconstructive and destructive interference of quantum pathways. Two coupling\nschemes of practical importance are investigated. In the first, a ladder energy\nlevel scheme, fully-resonant sum-frequency nonlinear-optical generation of\nshort-wavelength radiation driven by several strong fields is investigated. The\nrelaxation processes as well as absorption of the fundamental and generated\nradiations, which play an important role, are taken into consideration. It is\nshown that the generation output can be considerably increased through the\nappropriate adjustment of several laser-induced continuum structures. In the\nsecond, a folded scheme, a possible control of two-photon dissociation\n(Lambda-scheme) using auxiliary laser radiation applied to the adjacent\nbound-free transition (V-configuration) is investigated. Besides dissociation,\nthe proposed method enables one to control population transfer between two\nupper discreet levels via the lower-energy dissociation continuum, while direct\ntransition between these states is not allowed. The opportunities of\nmanipulating these processes as well as of four-wave-mixing-based spectroscopy\nare explored both analytically and through a numerical simulation for Na_2\ndimers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 2003 20:22:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Feb 2003 15:59:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

One is the\nwavepacket propagation on an adiabatic potential energy surface (PES), and the\nother is the electronic transition between PES's. Because the latter process is\nmathematically equivalent to nonadiabatic transitions between Floquet (dressed)\nstates, we can control such a process using the semiclassical Zhu-Nakamura\ntheory for nonadiabatic transitions. For the former process, we incorporate\nsemiclassical propagation methods such as the Herman-Kluk propagator into\noptimization procedures like optimal control theory. We show some numerical\nexamples for our strategies.
