The accuracy\nto which this can be done depends on the choice of passband combination and,\ncrucially, also on the wavelength range covered. Understanding the systematic\nuncertainties is of the utmost importance for a well-balanced interpretation of\nthe properties of extragalactic star cluster systems. We simultaneously obtain\nages, metallicities and extinction values for ~300 clusters in the nearby\nstarburst galaxy NGC 3310, based on archival Hubble Space Telescope\nobservations from the ultraviolet (UV) to the near-infrared (NIR). We show\nthat, for ages 6 <= log(age/yr) <= 9, and if one can only obtain partial\ncoverage of the spectral energy distribution (SED), an optical passband\ncombination of at least four filters including BOTH blue AND red passbands\nresults in the most representative age distribution. We find that while\nblue-selected passband combinations lead to age distributions that are slightly\nbiased towards younger ages due to the age-metallicity degeneracy,\nred-dominated passband combinations should be avoided. NGC 3310 underwent a\nglobal burst of cluster formation ~3x10^7 yr ago.

The best fit ionized reflection model requires the Fe K line to\nbe split into two reprocessing events: one from the inner disc to build up the\nred wing, and the other from the outer accretion disc to fit the blue horn. The\nimplied geometry is a disc which becomes strongly warped or flared at large\nradii. A good fit was obtained with a solar abundance of iron and a reflection\nfraction (R) of unity for the inner reflector. The combination of the two\nreflection spectra can appear to have R>2 as required by the BeppoSAX data. The\ninner reflector has an ionization parameter \\log \\xi =3.8, but the outer one is\nneutral with an inner radius ~70 gravitational radii (r_g), corresponding to a\nlight crossing time of about an hour for a 10^7 Msun black hole. Applying this\nmodel to time-resolved spectra shows that the inner reflector becomes more\nionized as the source brightens. This reduces the strength of the red wing at\nhigh flux states. The X-ray source is constrained to arise from a narrow\nannulus at ~5 r_g, with only 6 per cent of the 2-10 keV flux due to the outer\nreprocessor. This amount of localized energy generation is extremely difficult\nto produce without resorting to other energy sources such as the black hole\nspin.

The proposed model explains recent\nobservations for Omega Cen stars, and divides star formation into three epochs.\nAt the end of the first epoch, ~ 70% of the gas was expelled by supernovae. AGB\nstars then supplied s-process elements to the remaining gas during the first\ninterval of ~300 Myr. This explains the observed sudden increase in Ba/Fe\nratios in Omega Cen stars at [Fe/H] ~ -1.6. Supernovae at the end of the second\nepoch were unable to expel the gas. Eventually, Type Ia supernovae initiated\nsupernova-induced star formation, and remaining gas was stripped when the\ncluster passed through the newly formed disk of the Milky Way. The formation of\nOmega Cen is also discussed in the framework of globular cluster formation\ntriggered by cloud-cloud collisions. In this scenario, the relative velocity of\nclouds in the collision determines the later chemical evolution in the\nclusters. A head-on collision of proto-cluster clouds with a low relative\nvelocity would have converted less than 1% of gas into stars and promoted the\nsubsequent chemical evolution by supernova-driven star formation. This is\nconsistent with present observed form of Omega Cen. In contrast, the other\nGalactic globular clusters are expected to have formed from more intense\nhead-on collisions, and the resultant clouds would have been too thin for\nsupernovae to accumulate enough gas to form the next generation of stars. This\nexplains the absence of chemical evolution in these other globular clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Feb 2003 04:58:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

As a\nresult too many parameters are introduced to fit the mass of a composite\nfermion (CF) and hence experimentally, it will not be possible to identify all\nof such quasiparticles and their masses. Further, according to Ichinose, an\nelectron decay should occur but it has not been found. It is much too\nunrealistic to expect an electron decay similar to the neutron decay. If the CF\nis really found it is not going to be relevent to the quantum Hall effect.\nTherefore, the composite fermion (CF) model of quantum Hall effect is not well\nfounded and should be discarded.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Feb 2003 09:30:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

On\nthe other hand, it is known that the divergent terms in the regularized (but\nnot yet renormalized) total vacuum energy are associated with the heat kernel\ncoefficients. Here a recent study of the relations among the eigenvalue\ndensity, the heat kernel, and the integral kernel of the operator\n$e^{-t\\sqrt{H}}$ is exploited to characterize this association completely.\nVarious previously isolated observations about the structure of the regularized\nenergy emerge naturally. For over 20 years controversies have persisted\nstemming from the fact that certain (presumably physically meaningful) terms in\nthe renormalized vacuum energy density in the interior of a cavity become\nsingular at the boundary and correlate to certain divergent terms in the\nregularized total energy. The point of view of the present paper promises to\nhelp resolve these issues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2003 21:19:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Apr 2003 19:02:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
