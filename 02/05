In both models the impact on Lick indices due to alpha/Fe\nenhancement is accounted for through a modification of the stellar absorption\nline-strengths using the response functions of Tripicco & Bell (1995). One set\nof models, however, uses solar-scaled, the other alpha/Fe enhanced stellar\nevolutionary tracks. Since the alpha/Fe enhanced tracks are hotter than the\nsolar-scaled ones (Salasnich et al. 2000), the correspondent stellar population\nmodels have slightly weaker metallic indices (i.e. Mgb, <Fe> etc.) and stronger\nBalmer line indices (Hbeta) (Maraston et al 2003).

The radio spectra of planetary nebulae at high frequencies\nalso are not comfortably consistent with the standard theory (Siodmiak &\nTylenda 2001). Here we show that the account for an induced character of\nradiation processes sufficiently improves the predictions of the standard\ntheory.\n  Moreover, the developed here theory of radio emission from non-uniform gas\ngives the radio spectra of extended sources, such as supernova remnants and\nradio galaxies, which are normally attributed to the synchrotron emission. It\nis important, in this aspect, that the synchrotron self-absorption produces a\nchange in the polarization position angle across the spectral peak. No such a\nchange was detected in gigahertz-peaked spectrum sources (Mutoh et al. 2002).\nBesides, the flat or slightly inverted radio spectra of low-luminosity active\ngalactic nuclei are not easily consistent with the synchrotron radiation\nmechanism (Nagar, Wilson & Falcke 2001, Ulvestad & Ho 2001).\n  Thermal radiation in a magnetic field is polarized (see, e.g., Lang 1978).\nThis is also true for radiation considered in the present paper, which can be\ndescribed as incoherent induced radiation (Prigara 2001b).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Feb 2003 11:01:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

For the 6s-7s transition in 133Cs, we obtain a result that\nis about 40% smaller than that found previously by Bouchiat and Piketty [Phys.\nLett. B 269, 195 (1991)]. Applying this result to 133Cs, leads to an increase\nin the experimental value of nuclear anapole moment and exacerbates differences\nbetween constraints on PNC meson coupling constants obtained from the Cs\nanapole moment and those obtained from other nuclear parity violating\nexperiments. Nuclear spin-dependent PNC dipole matrix elements, including\ncontributions from the combined weak-hyperfine interaction, are also given for\nthe 7s-8s transition in 211Fr and for transitions between ground-state\nhyperfine levels in K, Rb, Cs, Ba+, Au, Tl, Fr, and Ra+.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2003 18:35:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 8 Feb 2003 17:17:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Although incoherent and exhibiting the statistics of\na thermal noise, broadband squeezed vacuum is shown to induce certain\ntwo-photon interactions as a coherent ultrashort pulse with the same spectral\nbandwidth. Utilizing pulse-shaping techniques we coherently control the\nsum-frequency generation of broadband squeezed vacuum over a range of two\norders of magnitude. Coherent control of two-photon interactions with broadband\nsqueezed vacuum can potentially obtain spectral resolutions and extinction\nratios that are practically unattainable with coherent pulses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Feb 2003 15:14:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-06"}
