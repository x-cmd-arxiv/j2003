We use spin-dependent continuity\nequations and transport equations at the drift-diffusion level of\napproximation. Spin-polarized electron current and density in the semiconductor\nare described for four scenarios corresponding to the injection or the\ncollection of spin polarized electrons at Schottky contacts to n-type or p-type\nsemiconductors. The transport properties of the interface are described by a\nspin-dependent interface resistance, resulting from an interfacial tunneling\nregion. The spin-dependent interface resistance is crucial for achieving spin\ninjection or spin polarization sensitivity in these configurations. We find\nthat the depletion region resulting from Schottky barrier formation at a\nmetal/semiconductor interface is detrimental to both spin injection and spin\ndetection. However, the depletion region can be tailored using a doping density\nprofile to minimize these deleterious effects. For example, a heavily doped\nregion near the interface, such as a delta-doped layer, can be used to form a\nsharp potential profile through which electrons tunnel to reduce the effective\nSchottky energy barrier that determines the magnitude of the depletion region.\nThe model results indicate that efficient spin-injection and spin-polarization\ndetection can be achieved in properly designed structures and can serve as a\nguide for the structure design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2003 16:51:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
