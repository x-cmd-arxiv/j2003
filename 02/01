A class of widely used\npotentials for coarse grained models of proteins are contact potentials in the\nform of weighted linear sum of pairwise contacts.

We\ndevelop an alternative framework for designing protein potential. We describe\nhow finding optimal protein potential can be understood from two geometric\nviewpoints, and we derive nonlinear potentials using mixture of Gaussian kernel\nfunctions for folding and design. The optimization criterion for obtaining\nparameters of the potential is to minimize bounds on the generalization error\nof discriminating protein structures and decoys not used in training. In our\nexperiment we use a training set of 440 protein structures repre senting a\nmajor portion of all known protein structures, and about 14 million structure\ndecoys and sequence decoys obtained by gapless threading.

This type of\npolarization current is found in recent practical machines designed to\ninvestigate superluminal emission. We find that the superluminal motion of the\ndistribution pattern of the emitting current generates localized\nelectromagnetic waves that do not decay spherically, i.e. that do not have an\nintensity diminishing like ${R_P}^{-2}$ with the distance $R_P$ from their\nsource.
