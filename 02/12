The usual derivation of gravity-matter couplings within the\nquantum-field-theoretic framework is reviewed. A number of inconsistencies\nbetween this derivation of the couplings, and the known results of tidal\neffects on test particles according to classical general relativity are pointed\nout. As a step towards resolving these inconsistencies, a General Laboratory\nFrame fixed on the worldline of an observer is constructed. In this frame, the\ndynamics of nonrelativistic test particles in the linearized gravity limit is\nstudied, and their Hamiltonian dynamics is derived. It is shown that for\nstationary metrics this Hamiltonian reduces to the usual Hamiltonian for\nnonrelativistic particles undergoing geodesic motion. For nonstationary metrics\nwith long-wavelength gravitational waves (GWs) present, it reduces to the\nHamiltonian for a nonrelativistic particle undergoing geodesic\n\\textit{deviation} motion. Arbitrary-wavelength GWs couple to the test particle\nthrough a vector-potential-like field $N_a$, the net result of the tidal forces\nthat the GW induces in the system, namely, a local velocity field on the system\ninduced by tidal effects as seen by an observer in the general laboratory\nframe.

To solve these ambiguities we turn to the vacuum polarization, which,\ndue to its special unitarity properties, guarantees the physical decoupling of\nthe heavy modes.

For [$\\chi ^{(3)}$] nonlinearity, the model finds two different\ninterpretations in terms of optical waveguide arrays, based on the\ndiffraction-management concept. A straightforward discrete [$\\chi ^{(2)}$]\nmodel, with opposite signs of the diffraction at the fundamental and second\nharmonics, is introduced also. Starting from the anti-continuum (AC) limit,\nsoliton solutions in the $\\chi ^{(3)}$ model are found, both above the phonon\nband and inside the gap. Solitons above the gap may be stable as long as they\nexist, but in the transition to the continuum limit they inevitably disappear.\nOn the contrary, solitons inside the gap persist all the way up to the\ncontinuum limit. In the zero-mismatch case, they lose their stability long\nbefore reaching the continuum limit, but finite mismatch can have a stabilizing\neffect on them. A special procedure is developed to find discrete counterparts\nof the Bragg-grating gap solitons. It is concluded that they exist all the\nvalues of the coupling constant, but are stable only in the AC and continuum\nlimits. Solitons are also found in the $\\chi ^{(2)}$ model.

Direct numerical simulations\nin the cases of instability reveal a variety of scenarios, including\nspontaneous transformation of the solitons into breather-like states,\ndestruction of one of the components (in favor of the other), and\nsymmetry-breaking effects.
