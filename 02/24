The WD can accrete and burn hydrogen-rich matter atop the WD at the\ncritical rate. The excess matter transferred to the WD above the critical rate\nis expelled by winds. This is called the accretion wind evolution. This\nejection process, however, occurs intermittently because the mass transfer is\nattenuated by strong winds: the strong winds collide with the secondary surface\nand strip off the very surface layer of the secondary. The matter stripped-off\nis lost from the binary system.
