This structure has been proposed to correspond to the\nexperimentally observed (4x4) phase. With increasing O concentrations, thicker\noxide-like structures resembling compressed Ag2O(111) surfaces are\nenergetically favored. Due to the relatively low thermal stability of these\nstructures, and the very low sticking probability of O2 at Ag(111), their\nformation and observation may require the use of atomic oxygen (or ozone, O3)\nand low temperatures.

Surprisingly, we find the transition to be abrupt for bipartite\nsystems: distillable states emerge arbitrarily close to the LSB. For\nmultipartite systems, while the radius of the LSB remains unknown, we determine\nthe radius of the largest undistillable ball. Our results also provide an upper\nbound on how noisy shared entangled states can be for executing quantum\ninformation processing protocols.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Feb 2003 02:08:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2004 17:54:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

In the calculations,\nthe electromagnetic fields are treated classically in the hydrodynamic case,\nbut are quantized in QED. Calculations show the hydrodynamic model to have a\ndifferent and more sensitive dependence on the size and shape of the radiating\nparticle's wave packet then does QED. In particular it is shown that\nbremsstrahlung is sometimes greatly reduced when the force acting on the\nparticle is localized to a volume small compared to the particle's wave packet.\nQED exhibits no such reduction. Therefore it is possible to test this effect\nexperimentally.\n  An experiment is proposed. It involves an electron microscope with a Wien\nfilter for producing monochromatic beam electrons and an accurate energy\nmeasurement of the particle after passing through a local force field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Feb 2003 02:05:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2006 22:09:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
