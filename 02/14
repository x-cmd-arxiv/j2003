This is the most natural\noutcome of the supranova model, where initially a supernova (SN) explosion\ntakes place, leaving behind a supra-massive neutron star, which loses its\nrotational energy over a time t_sd and collapses to a black hole, triggering a\nGRB. We find that the time delay, t_sd, between the SN and GRB events is the\nmost important parameter that determines the behavior of the system. We\nconsider the afterglow, prompt GRB and PWB emission. Constraints on the model\nare derived for a spherical PWB, from current afterglow observations and the\nlack of direct detection of the PWB emission. We find that a simple spherical\nmodel cannot account for the X-ray features detected in some afterglows,\ntogether with the typical afterglow emission that was observed for the same\nGRBs. The discrepancies with observations may be reconciled by resorting to a\nnon-spherical geometry, where the PWB is elongated along the polar axis.\nFinally, we predict that the inverse Compton upscattering of PWB photons by the\nrelativistic electrons of the afterglow (external Compton) should lead to high\nenergy emission during the early afterglow that may explain the GeV photons\ndetected by EGRET for a few GRBs, and should be detectable by future missions\nsuch as GLAST.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2003 15:38:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

KS is a Lagrangian model of turbulent diffusion that makes no\nuse of any delta correlation in time at any level. With this approach,\nsituations with a very large range of inertial scales and varying persistence\nof spatial flow structure can be studied.\n  We first show numerically that the model flow reproduces recent experimental\nresults at low Reynolds numbers.
