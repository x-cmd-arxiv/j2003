Here, we show that existing measurements of the IGM\ntemperature from the Lyman-alpha forest at z ~ 2 - 4 rule out this ``vanilla''\nmodel. Under reasonable assumptions about the ionizing spectrum, as long as the\nuniverse is reionized before z = 10, and remains highly ionized thereafter, the\nIGM reaches an asymptotic thermal state which is too cold compared to\nobservations. To simultaneously satisfy the CMB and forest constraints, the\nreionization history must be complex: reionization begins early at z >~ 15, but\nthere must have been significant (order unity) changes in fractions of neutral\nhydrogen and/or helium at 6 < z < 10, and/or singly ionized helium at 4 < z <\n10. We describe a physically motivated reionization model that satisfies all\ncurrent observations. We also explore the impact of a stochastic reionization\nhistory and show that a late epoch of (HeII --> HeIII) reionization induces a\nsignificant scatter in the IGM temperature, but the scatter diminishes with\ntime quickly. Finally, we provide an analytic formula for the thermal\nasymptote, and discuss possible additional heating mechanisms that might evade\nour constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Feb 2003 20:56:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 Feb 2003 22:08:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 7 Apr 2003 19:02:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
