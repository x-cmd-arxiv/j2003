We are able to show that this new class generates bohmian\ntrajectories which begin classical (with decelerated expansion), undergo an\naccelerated expansion in the middle of its evolution due to the presence of\nquantum cosmological effects in this period, and return to its classical\ndecelerated expansion in the far future. We also show that the relation between\nluminosity distance and redshift in the quantum cosmological model can be made\nclose to the corresponding relation coming from the classical model suplemented\nby a cosmological constant, for $z<1$. These results suggest the posibility of\ninterpreting the present observations of high redshift supernovae as the\nmanifestation of a quantum cosmological effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Feb 2003 15:24:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We show that the main structures of quantum theory (interference of\nprobabilities, Born's rule, complex probabilistic amplitudes, Hilbert state\nspace, representation of observables by operators) are present in a latent form\nin the classical Kolmogorov probability model. However, this model should be\nconsidered as a calculus of contextual probabilities. In our approach it is\nforbidden to consider abstract context independent probabilities: ``first\ncontext and then probability.'' We start with the conventional formula of total\nprobability for contextual (conditional) probabilities and then we rewrite it\nby eliminating combinations of incompatible contexts from consideration. In\nthis way we obtain interference of probabilities without to appeal to the\nHilbert space formalism or wave mechanics. However, we did not just reconstruct\nthe probabilistic formalism of conventional quantum mechanics. Our contextual\nprobabilistic model is essentially more general and, besides the projection to\nthe complex Hilbert space, it has other projections. The most important new\nprediction is the possibility (at least theoretical) of appearance of\nhyperbolic interference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Feb 2003 09:57:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Nov 2003 08:54:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2004 09:11:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2005 07:49:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
