The maser emission traces a warped,\nedge-on accretion disk between radii of 0.11+/-0.02 and ~0.40 pc, as well as a\nwide-angle outflow that extends up to ~1 pc from the estimated disk center. The\ndisk rotation is close to Keplerian (v varies as 1/sqrt(r)), the maximum\ndetected rotation speed is 260 km/s, and the inferred central mass is 1.7+/-0.3\nx 10^6 solar masses. The outflowing masers are irregularly distributed above\nand below the disk, with relative outflow velocities up to ~+/-160 km/s,\nprojected along the line of sight. The flow probably originates closer than 0.1\npc to the central engine, possibly in an inward extension of the accretion\ndisk, though there is only weak evidence of rotation in the outward moving\nmaterial. We observe that the warp of the disk appears to collimate the outflow\nand to fix the extent of the ionization cone observed on larger angular scales.\nThis study provides the first direct evidence (i.e., through imaging) of dusty,\nhigh-density, molecular material in a nuclear outflow <1 pc from the central\nengine of a Seyfert galaxy, as well as the first graphic evidence that warped\naccretion disks can channel outflows and illumination patterns in AGN.

Indirect\narguments suggest that some \"true\" type 2 AGN, i.e. AGN having no obscured BLR\ndo exist, but it is not clear why the BLR is missing in these AGN. Here we\npoint out a possible natural explanation. The observed radius-luminosity\nrelation for the BLR implies an increasing line width with decreasing\nluminosity for a given black hole mass (Mbh). In addition, there appears to be\nan upper limit to the observed width of broad emission lines in AGN of Delta\nv_max~25,000 km/s, which may reflect a physical limit above which the BLR may\nnot be able to survive. Thus, at a low enough luminosity the BLR radius shrinks\nbelow the Delta v_max radius, leaving no region where the BLR can exist,\nalthough the AGN may remain otherwise `normal'. The implied minimum bolometric\nluminosity required to sustain a BLR with Delta v<25,000 km/s is\nL_min~10^{41.8}(Mbh}/10^8M_sun)^2.

Our formulation is most general in the sense that\nit is applicable even when a stationary axisymmetric spacetime is noncircular,\nthat is, even when it is impossible to foliate a spacetime with two orthogonal\nfamilies of two-surfaces. The GS equation for noncircular spacetimes is crucial\nfor the study of relativistic stars with a toroidal magnetic field or\nmeridional flow, such as magnetars, since the existence of a toroidal field or\nmeridional flow violates the circularity of a spacetime. We also derive the\nwind equation in noncircular spacetimes, and discuss various limits of the GS\nequation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2003 10:18:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Mar 2003 00:54:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 19 Apr 2003 10:31:48 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 2 May 2003 11:38:51 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 8 May 2003 01:10:19 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 8 Sep 2003 04:38:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-09"}
