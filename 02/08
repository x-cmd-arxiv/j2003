The temperature fluctuation\nof very small dust particles is calculated consistently with the radiative\ntransfer. The adopted dust model consists of graphite and silicate grains and\nPAHs, whose relative fractions are determined for each MW, LMC and SMC type\nextinction curve. This model allows us to derive the intrinsic SEDs of stellar\npopulations embedded in dusty ISM, which are very important indicators for the\nage of stellar populations. Therefore, the evolutionary phase of starburst\ngalaxies which have frequently very dusty ISM can be investigated with this SED\nmodel. We show that the SEDs of Arp220 and M82 can both be explained by the\nsame single stellar population, despite the significant differences in the SEDs\nand the infrared luminosities. The apparent difference between their SEDs is\nmainly caused by the difference in the optical depth. In contrast, the SED of\nprototypical star-forming ERO, HR10, indicates that this galaxy is relatively\nold comparing to Arp220 and M82.
