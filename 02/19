This is the most massive stellar association known in the Galaxy,\nestimated to contain ~2600 OB type members alone. It has been previously argued\nthat the large scale shocks and turbulence induced by the multiple interacting\nsupersonic winds from the many young stars in such associations may play a role\nin accelerating Galactic cosmic rays. Indeed, Cyg OB2 also coincides with the\nnon-variable MeV-GeV range unidentified EGRET source, 3EG 2033+4118. We report\non the near-simultaneous follow-up observations of the extended TeV source\nregion with the CHANDRA X-ray Observatory and the Very Large Array (VLA) radio\ntelescope obtained in order to explore this possibility. Analysis of the CO,\nHI, and IRAS 100 micron emissions shows that the TeV source region coincides\nwith an outlying sub-group of powerful OB stars which have evacuated or\ndestroyed much of the ambient atomic, molecular and dust material, and which\nmay be related to the very high-energy emissions. An interesting SNR-like\nstructure is also revealed near the TeV source region in the CO, HI and radio\nemission maps. Applying a numerical simulation which accurately tracks the\nradio to gamma-ray emission from primary hadrons as well as primary and\nsecondary e+/-, we find that the broadband spectrum of the TeV source region\nfavors a predominantly nucleonic - rather than electronic - origin of the\nhigh-energy flux, though deeper X-ray and radio observations are needed to\nconfirm this.

The existence of such a spectral feature is\nexpected or may be naturally interpreted in terms of radiative ageing of\nsynchrotron emitting electrons. The small angular size of CSS sources makes it\nrelatively easy to measure their integrated spectra over a wide frequency range\nfor a conspicuous number of objects. For those sources whose emission is\ndominated by the mini-lobes, the integrated spectra can be used to constrain\nthe source age. Assuming equipartition magnetic fields, the spectral ages we\nfound are in the range from 10^2 to 10^5 yr. Multifrequency VLBA observations\nallow us to study the spectral properties of two CSOs: B1323+321 and B1943+546.\nThe case of B1943+546 is particularly interesting since for this source a\nkinematic age has been derived from the proper motion of the hot spots. We\nfound that spectral and kinematic ages agree within a factor of 2. The overall\nresults presented here confirm that the CSOs and CSS sources are indeed young\nobjects. Finally, we show some examples of compact sources characterised by an\nextraordinary steep and curved spectrum. It is plausible that these are relic\nsources in which the injection of fresh electrons has ceased for a significant\nfraction of their lifetime. These observations may indicate either the presence\nof intermittent activity or a class of short-living objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2003 09:43:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The conventional\nview is that a Kosterlitz-Thouless-Berezinskii transition occurs as long as\nfinite size effects do not obscure the transition. However, there have been\nrecent suggestions that a different transition actually occurs which\nincorporates aspects of both the dynamic scaling theory of Fisher, Fisher, and\nHuse and the Kosterlitz-Thouless-Berezinskii transition. Of general interest is\nthat this modified transition apparently has a universal dynamic critical\nexponent. Some have countered that this apparent universal behavior is rooted\nin a newly proposed finite-size scaling theory; one that also incorporates\nscaling and conventional two-dimensional theory. To investigate these issues we\nstudy DC voltage versus current data of a 12 angstrom thick YBCO film. We find\nthat the newly proposed scaling theories have intrinsic flexibility that is\nrelevant to the analysis of the experiments. In particular, the data scale\naccording to the modified transition for arbitrarily defined critical\ntemperatures between 0 K and 19.5 K, and the temperature range of a successful\nscaling collapse is related directly to the sensitivity of the measurement.\nThis implies that the apparent universal exponent is due to the intrinsic\nflexibility rather than some real physical property. To address this intrinsic\nflexibility, we propose a criterion which would give conclusive evidence for\nphase transitions in two-dimensional superconductors.

A new method of the solution of\nproblems, traditionally associated with Fredholm integral equations of the\nfirst kind, is developed. Its key aspect is a constructive use of possibilities\nof the functional space $l_2$ to ensure the conditions of correctness. A\nwell-known phenomenon of smoothing of information is taken into account by\nmeans of a special composition that explicitly involves the sought function and\nis infinitesimal in the space $L_2$. By relatively simple transformations, the\noutlined class of problems is reduced to the solution of Fredholm integral\nequations of the second kind with properties most favorable for the numerical\nrealization. We demonstrate a reduction to Fredholm integral equations of the\nfirst kind and, correspondingly, a possibility to extend the suggested approach\nto wide classes of linear and nonlinear boundary-value and\ninitial-boundary-value problems.

However, in\na number of recent studies, a prevalence of antagonistic epistasis (the\ntendency of multiple mutations to have a mitigating rather than reinforcing\neffect) has been observed.\n  Results: We studied in silico the net amount and form of epistatic\ninteractions in RNA secondary structure folding by measuring the fraction of\nneutral mutants as a function of mutational distance d. We found a clear\nprevalence of antagonistic epistasis in RNA secondary structure folding. By\nrelating the fraction of neutral mutants at distance d to the average\nneutrality at distance d, we showed that this prevalence derives from the\nexistence of many compensatory mutations at larger mutational distances.\n  Conclusions: Our findings imply that the average direction of epistasis in\nsimple fitness landscapes is directly related to the density with which fitness\npeaks are distributed in these landscapes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2003 19:40:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It is known that A\ncan be exponentially large in d so just to write down A we need exponential\ntime in the input size log d. Hence we introduce the regulator R=ln A and ask\nfor the value of R to n decimal places. The best known classical algorithm has\nsub-exponential running time O(exp(sqrt(log d)), poly(n)). Hallgren's quantum\nalgorithm gives the result in polynomial time O(poly(log d),poly(n)) with\nprobability 1/poly(log d).
