For a minihalo\nwith virial temperature T_vir < 10,000 K, the I-front gradually burned its way\nthrough the minihalo which trapped it, removing all of its baryonic gas by\ncausing a supersonic, evaporative wind to blow backwards into the IGM, away\nfrom the exposed layers of minihalo gas just behind the advancing I-front.\n  Such hitherto neglected feedback effects were widespread during reionization.\nN-body simulations and analytical estimates of halo formation suggest that\nsub-kpc minihalos such as these, with T_vir < 10,000 K, were so common as to\ndominate the absorption of ionizing photons. This means that previous estimates\nof the number of ionizing photons per H atom required to complete reionization\nwhich neglected this effect may be too low. Regardless of their effect on the\nprogress of reionization, however, the minihalos were so abundant that random\nlines of sight thru the high-z universe should encounter many of them, which\nsuggests that it may be possible to observe the processes described here in the\nabsorption spectra of distant sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2003 00:11:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Ground-based optical observations started about 1 day after the GRB\nand spanned a period of ~10 days; archival HST data extended the coverage up to\n70 days after the GRB. We report the first detection of the afterglow in NIR\nbands. The detection of emission lines in the optical spectrum indicates that\nthe GRB is located at z = 0.691. Absorptions are also detected at z = 0.691 and\nat z = 0.472. The latter system is likely caused by clouds in a galaxy located\n2 arcsec southwest of the GRB host. Hence, for the first time, the galaxy\nresponsible for an intervening absorption system in the spectrum of a GRB\nafterglow is identified. Optical and NIR photometry indicates that the decay in\nall bands follows a single power law of index alpha = 1.54. The late-epoch VLT\nand HST points lie above the extrapolation of this power law, so that a plateau\nis apparent in the VRIJ light curves at 10-20 days after the GRB. The light\ncurves at epochs later than day ~20 after the GRB are consistent with a\npower-law decay with index alphaprime = 1.85.

Alternatively, a shock\nre-energization may be responsible for the rebrightening. A polarimetric R-band\nmeasurement shows that the afterglow is polarized, with P = 1.5 % and theta =\n172 degrees. Optical-NIR spectral flux distributions show a change of slope\nacross the J band which we interpret as due to the presence of nu_c.

This leads to a disorder\ndistribution, which after a finite renomalization becomes non-analytic, thus\novercoming the predictions of the seemingly exact dimensional reduction.

A bidirectionally pumped ring cavity builds up a resonantly\nenhanced optical standing wave which acts to confine polarizable particles in\ndeep potential wells. The particle localization yields a coupling of the\ndegenerate travelling wave modes via coherent photon redistribution. This\ninduces a splitting of the cavity resonances with a high frequency component,\nthat is tuned to the anti-Stokes Raman sideband of the particles oscillating in\nthe potential wells, yielding cooling due to excess anti-Stokes scattering.\nTight confinement in the optical lattice together with the prediction, that\nmore than 50% of the trapped particles can be cooled into the motional ground\nstate, promise high phase space densities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2003 12:47:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
