With increasing\nthe Sr- or Ba-concentration x, the system becomes metallic ferromagnet with\nrather large magnetic moments. For R=Pr and Nd and A=Ca, the system approaches\nthe metal- insulator phase boundary but does not become metallic. The magnetic\nmoments of the Ca-doped systems measured with the magnetic field H=0.1 T are\nmuch smaller than those of the Ba- and Sr-doped systems. The thermoelectric\npowers of the Ba- and Sr-doped systems decrease from large positive values of\nlightly doped samples to negative ones with increasing doping level, while\nthose of Ca-doped systems remain positive. These results can be understood by\nconsidering the relationship between the average ionic radius of R1-xAx and the\nenergy difference between the low spin and intermediate spin states. We have\nfound the resistivity-anomaly in the measurements of Pr1-xCaxCoO3 under\npressure in the wide region of x, which indicates the existence of a phase\ntransition different from the one reported in the very restricted region of\nx~0.5 at ambient pressure [Tsubouchi et al. Phys. Rev. B 66 (2002) 052418.].

The proposed new dynamics is characterized by the feature of not\ncontradicting any known fact about microsystems and of accounting, on the basis\nof a unique, universal dynamical principle, for wavepacket reduction and for\nthe classical behavior of macroscopic systems. We recall the motivations for\nthe new approach and we briefly review the other proposals to circumvent the\nabove mentioned difficulties which appeared in the literature. In this way we\nmake clear the conceptual and historical context characterizing the new\napproach. After having reviewed the mathematical techniques (stochastic\ndifferential calculus) which are essential for the rigorous and precise\nformulation of the new dynamics, we discuss in great detail its implications\nand we stress its relevant conceptual achievements. The new proposal requires\nalso to work out an appropriate interpretation; a procedure which leads us to a\nreconsideration of many important issues about the conceptual status of\ntheories based on a genuinely Hilbert space description of natural processes.\nWe also discuss the possibility and the problems one meets in trying to develop\nan analogous formalism for the relativistic case. Finally we discuss the\nexperimental implications of the new dynamics for various physical processes\nwhich should allow, in principle, to test it against quantum mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Feb 2003 11:30:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Apr 2003 14:46:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
