An X-ray afterglow emission in the\n2-10 keV energy band was detected with BeppoSAX, but an analogue search at\nlower wavelengths (optical, IR and radio) was unsuccessful. The X-ray afterglow\nspectrum is consistent with a power-law with Galactic absorption. The light\ncurve shows a complex decay, if the tail of the prompt emission is assumed as\nthe onset of the afterglow: if the origin of the afterglow is coincident with\nthe GRB onset, a bump before ~ 3 x 10^4 s is inferred, while if the afterglow\nis assumed to start later, a steepening of the power-law light curve at t ~ 3 x\n10^4 s is deduced.

We ask whether the action of dispersive\nrotational forcing alone, $U^\\perp$, prevents the generic finite time breakdown\nof the free nonlinear convection. The answer provided in this work is a\nconditional yes. Namely, we show that the rotating Euler equations admit global\nsmooth solutions for a subset of generic initial configurations. With other\nconfigurations, however, finite time breakdown of solutions may and actually\ndoes occur. Thus, global regularity depends on whether the initial\nconfiguration crosses an intrinsic, ${\\mathcal O}(1)$ critical threshold, which\nis quantified in terms of the initial vorticity, $\\omega_0=\\nabla \\times U_0$,\nand the initial spectral gap associated with the $2\\times 2$ initial velocity\ngradient, $\\eta_0:=\\lambda_2(0)-\\lambda_1(0), \\lambda_j(0)= \\lambda_j(\\nabla\nU_0)$.

The average of the drift is\ngoverned by a degenerate Hamiltonian whose set of critical points has an\ninterior. The dynamics of the system is studied in the presence of three time\nscales. Using the martingale problem approach and separating the time scales,\nwe average the system to show convergence to a Markov process on a stratified\nspace. The averaging combines the deterministic time averaging of periodic\ncoefficients, and the stochastic averaging of the resulting system. The\ncorresponding strata of the reduced space are a two-sphere, a point and a line\nsegment. Special attention is given to the description of the domain of the\nlimiting generator, including the analysis of the gluing conditions at the\npoint where the strata meet. These gluing conditions, resulting from the\neffects of the hierarchy of time scales, are similar to the conditions on the\ndomain of skew Brownian motion and are related to the description of spider\nmartingales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Feb 2003 06:04:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
