The\nstrength of the unidentified feature was observed to correlate very well with\nthat of the water ice bending mode and far less strongly with the CO2 ice\nbending mode.

The star distance (~120-140 pc) implies a radiation radius of at most\n\\~5-6 km, too small for any neutron star equation of state. Proposed\nexplanations for such a small radius include a reduced X-ray emitting region\n(as a polar cap), or the presence of a more compact object, as a bare\nquark/strange star. However, both interpretations rely on the presumption that\nthe quark star or the cap radiates a pure blackbody spectrum, and no\njustification for this assumption has been presented yet. Here we discuss an\nalternative possibility. Cool neutron stars (T < 10^6 K) endowed with high\nmagnetic field (B > 10^13 G) may suffer a phase transition in the outermost\nlayers. The neutron star is then left bare of the gaseous atmosphere. We\ncomputed spectra from naked neutron stars with a surface Fe composition.\nDepending on B, we found that the 0.1-2 keV emission can be featureless and\nindistinguishable from a blackbody. Owing to the reduced surface emissivity,\nthe star only radiates ~30-50 % of the blackbody power, thus that the size of\nthe emitting region is larger than for a perfect planckian emitter. When\napplied to RX J1856.5-3754 our model accounts for the observed X-ray properties\nand solves the paradox of the small radius. The apparent star radius is ~10-12\nkm, consistent with equations of state of a neutron star. The optical emission\nof RX J1856.5-3754 may be explained by the presence a thin gaseous shell on the\ntop of the Fe condensate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 2003 12:30:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The classic example is ionic\nliving polymerization. In equilibrium, a delicate balance is maintained in\nwhich each initiated chain has a very small negative average growth rate\n(``velocity'') just sufficient to negate the effect of growth rate\nfluctuations. This leads to an exponential molecular weight distribution (MWD)\nwith mean Nbar. After a small perturbation of relative amplitude epsilon, e.g.\na small temperature jump, this balance is destroyed: the velocity acquires a\nboost greatly exceeding its tiny equilibrium value. For epsilon > epsilon_c =\n1/Nbar^{1/2} the response has 3 stages: (1) Coherent chain growth or shrinkage,\nleaving a highly non-linear hole or peak in the MWD at small chain lengths.\nDuring this episode, lasting time taufast ~ Nbar, the MWD's first moment and\nmonomer concentration m relax very close to equilibrium. (2) Hole-filling (or\npeak decay) after taufill ~ epsilon^2 Nbar^2. The absence or surfeit of small\nchains is erased. (3) Global MWD shape relaxation after tauslow ~ Nbar^2. By\nthis time second and higher MWD moments have relaxed. During episodes (2) and\n(3) the fast variables (Nbar,m) are enslaved to the slowly varying number of\nfree initiators (chains of zero length). Thus fast variables are\nquasi-statically fine-tuned to equilibrium. The outstanding feature of these\ndynamics is their ultrasensitivity: despite the perturbation's linearity, the\nresponse is non-linear until the late episode (3).

We study the simplicity postulates\nassumed in BFO's work and how to weaken them, so as to permit the inclusion of\nthe full set of matter fields known to occur in nature.\n  We study the configuration spaces of gravity-matter systems upon which BFO's\nformulation leans.

In this paper we explore some of\nthe implications of the modified guidance law.

The conditions for the\nclassical limit and the limit of negligible spin are given, and the empirical\nsufficiency of the model is demonstrated.
