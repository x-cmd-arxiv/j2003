In both cases we find very high Ni56 velocities of\n17000 km/s shortly after shock-revival, and a complete fragmentation of the\nprogenitor's metal core within the first few minutes after core bounce, due to\nthe growth of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities at the Si/O and (C+O)/He\ncomposition interfaces.

The low maximum metal velocities in the Type II model, which are\nsignificantly smaller than those observed in SN 1987A, are due to the massive\nhydrogen envelope of the progenitor. The envelope forces the supernova shock to\ndecelerate strongly, leaving behind a reverse shock below the He/H interface,\nwhich interacts with the clumps and slows them down significantly.

We wish to draw attention to a route to\nhydrodynamic turbulence which seems to be little known by the astrophysical\ncommunity, but which has been intensively discussed among fluid dynamicists\nduring the past decade. In this so-called `bypass' concept for the onset of\nturbulence, perturbations undergo a transient growth, and they may reach an\namplitude that is sufficiently large to allow positive feedback through\nnonlinear interactions. This transient growth is linear in nature, and thus it\ndiffers in principle from the well-known nonlinear instability. We describe the\ntype of perturbations that according to this process are the most likely to\nlead to turbulence, namely non-axisymmetric vortex mode perturbations in the\ntwo dimensional limit. We show that the apparently inhibiting action of the\nCoriolis force on the dynamics of such vortical perturbations is substantially\ndiminished due to the pressure perturbations, contrary to current opinion. We\nstress the similarity of the turbulent processes in Keplerian disks and in\nCartesian flows and conclude that the prevalent skepticism of the astrophysical\ncommunity on the occurrence of hydrodynamic shear turbulence in such disks is\nnot founded.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Feb 2003 13:03:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We show that for a general cost function the\noptimal diameters of mother ($d_0$) and daughter ($d_1$, $d_2$) branches at a\nbifurcation obey a branching law: $d_{0}^{\\nu+2}=d_{1}^{\\nu+2} +\nd_{2}^{\\nu+2}$. The derivation relies on the fact that the conduction speed\nscales with the axon diameter to the power $\\nu$ ($\\nu=1$ for myelinated axons\nand $\\nu=0.5$ for non-myelinated axons). We test the branching law on the\navailable experimental data and find a reasonable agreement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Feb 2003 17:15:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In\nstandard (mean-field-like) compartmental models the concept of the basic\nreproductive number, R0, has been systematically employed as a predictor for\nepidemic spread and as an analytical tool to study the threshold conditions.\nDespite the importance of this quantity, there are no general formulation of R0\nwhen one considers the spread of a disease in a generic finite population,\ninvolving, for instance, arbitrary topology of inter-individual interactions\nand heterogeneous mixing of susceptible and immune individuals. The goal of\nthis work is to study this concept in a generalized stochastic system described\nin terms of global and local variables. In particular, the dependence of R0 on\nthe space of parameters that define the model is investigated; it is found that\nnear of the ``classical'' epidemic threshold transition the uncertainty about\nthe strength of the epidemic process still is significantly large. The\nforecasting attributes of R0 for a discrete finite system is discussed and\ngeneralized; in particular, it is shown that, for a discrete finite system, the\npretentious predictive power of R0 is significantly reduced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Feb 2003 19:43:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Transition rates and line strengths are calculated for the\n3l-4l' electric-dipole (E1) transitions in Cu-like ions with nuclear charge Z =\n30 - 100. RMBPT including the Breit interaction is used to evaluate retarded E1\nmatrix elements in length and velocity forms.
