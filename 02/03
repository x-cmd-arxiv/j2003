These time series consist of two or three\nobservations separated by intervals ranging from a few days to several months.\nAlthough these time series provide the bare minimum of information required to\ndetect variations, this survey demonstrates that the O VI doublet in the winds\nof OB-type stars is variable on various scales both in time and velocity. For\nspectral types from O3 to B1, 64% vary in time. At spectral types later than\nB1, no wind variability is observed. This fraction represents a lower limit on\nthe true incidence of variability in the O VI wind lines, which is very common\nand probably ubiquitous. The observed variations extend over several hundreds\nof km/s of the wind profile and can be strong. The width over which the wind O\nVI profile varies is only weakly correlated with the terminal velocity (\\vinf),\nbut a significant correlation (close to a 1:1 relationship) is derived between\nthe maximum velocity of the variation and \\vinf. High velocity O VI wind\nabsorption features (possibly related to the discrete absorption components\nseen in other wind lines) are also observed in 46% of the cases for spectral\ntypes from O3 to B0.5. These features are variable, but the nature of their\npropagation cannot be determined from this survey. If X-rays can produce\nsufficient O VI by Auger ionization of O VI, and the X-rays originate from\nstrong shocks in the wind, this study suggests that stronger shocks occur more\nfrequently near \\vinf, causing an enhancement of O VI near \\vinf.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Feb 2003 22:24:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In the case of the radio galaxy 3C 129, the\nChandra observation shows, in addition to core and jet X-ray emission reported\nin an earlier paper, some evidence for extended, diffuse X-ray emission from a\nregion east of the radio core. The 12 arcsec x 36 arcsec (6 kpc x 17 kpc)\nregion lies \"in front\" of the radio core, in the same direction into which the\nradio galaxy is moving. We use the radio and X-ray data to study in detail the\npressure balance between the non-thermal radio plasma and the thermal Intra\nCluster Medium (ICM) along the tail of 3C 129 which extends over 15 arcmin (427\nkpc). Depending on the assumed lower energy cutoff of the electron energy\nspectrum, the minimum pressure of the radio plasma lies a factor of between 10\nand 40 below the ICM pressure for a large part of the tail. We discuss several\npossibilities to explain the apparent pressure mismatch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 2003 15:55:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Jul 2003 15:11:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Using the total multiplicity $N_{\\rm ch} = \\int (dN_{\\rm\nch}/d\\eta)d\\eta$, we find that there are scaling phenomena among $(N_{\\rm\nch})^{-1}dN_{\\rm ch}/d\\eta = dn/d\\eta$ with different centrality cuts at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 130 GeV and 200 GeV, respectively. To explain these scaling\nbehaviors of $dn/d\\eta$, we consider the stochastic approach named the\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck process with two sources. The following Fokker-Planck\nequation is adopted for the present analyses, $$ \\frac{\\partial\nP(x,t)}{\\partial t} = \\gamma [\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}x + \\frac\n12\\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\gamma}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}] P(x, t) $$ where $x$\nmeans the rapidity (y) or pseudo-rapidity ($\\eta$). $t$, $\\gamma$ and\n$\\sigma^2$ are the evolution parameter, the frictional coefficient and the\nvariance, respectively. Introducing a variable of $z_r = \\eta/\\eta_{\\rm rms}$\n($\\eta_{\\rm rms}=\\sqrt{< \\eta^2 >}$) we explain the $dn/d z_r$ distributions in\nthe present approach. Moreover, to explain the rapidity (y) distributions from\n$\\eta$ distributions at 200 GeV, we have derived the formula as $$\n\\frac{dn}{dy}=J^{-1}\\frac{dn}{d \\eta}, $$ where $J^{-1}=\\sqrt{M(1+\\sinh^2\ny)}/\\sqrt{1+M\\sinh^2 y}$ with $M = 1 + (m/p_{\\rm t})^2$. Their data of pion and\nall hadrons are fairly well explained by the O-U process. To compare our\napproach with another one, a phenomenological formula by Eskola et al. is also\nused in calculations of $dn/d\\eta$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 2003 09:00:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Four fields drive a\ndouble-lambda level scheme in the atoms, consisting of a pair of lambda systems\nsharing the same set of lower levels. Two of the fields produce maximum\ncoherence, rho12 = -1/2, between the ground state sublevels 1 and 2. This\npumping scheme involves equal intensity fields that are resonant with both the\none and two-photon transitions of the lambda system. There is no steady-state\nabsorption of these fields, implying that the fields induce a type\nelectromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) in the medium. An additional\npair of fields interacting with the second lambda system, combined with the EIT\nfields, leads to squeezing of the atom spin associated with the ground state\nsublevels. Our method involves a new mechanism for creating steady-state spin\nsqueezing using an optical cavity. As the cooperativity parameter C is\nincreased, the optimal squeezing varies as C^{-1/3}. For experimentally\naccessible values of C, squeezing as large as 90% can be achieved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Feb 2003 18:12:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
