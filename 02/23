Magnetic\nfields are natural for transmitting the energy from the central compact object\nto the small amount of baryons required for a GRB. When dissipation of the flux\nof magnetic energy by reconnection inside the flow is taken into account, the\nmagnetic model assumes several more convincing properties. For baryon loading\ntypical of observed GRB, most of the dissipation takes place just outside\nphotosphere, so that prompt emission is produced efficiently, and the magnetic\nfield strength in this region is high, resulting in efficient synchrotron\nemission. Remarkably, the dissipation also causes very efficient acceleration\nof the bulk flow. This effect is illustrated with a classical hydrodynamic\nequivalent. In this context, the distinction between the flux of magnetic\nenergy $cB^2/8\\pi$ and the Poynting flux $cB^2/4\\pi$ is important, and an\ninterpretation of the Poynting flux as a `magnetic enthalpy flux' illuminating.\nNumerical and analytical results for flow acceleration and the relative\ncontribution of photospheric (thermal) and nonthermal emission as functions of\nthe asymptotic bulk Lorentz factor are given.

There is always a second\nbody to give the gravitational barrier of a black hole a finite rather than\ninfinite width so that a particle can escape by tunneling. Thus GTR may be\nemitted from black holes in a process differing from that of Hawking radiation\n(HR) with broad ranging astrophysical ramifications. HR of an \"isolated\" black\nhole is an abstraction which has not been detected in three decades, and which\nmay not exist. GTR is beamed, in contrast to HR, which is isotropic. Little\nblack holes may account for much of the dark matter of the universe, and hence\nthe anomalous rotation of spiral galaxies, as well as contribute to the\naccelerated expansion of the universe. The absence of HR permits the existence\nof little black hole gravitationally bound atoms with quantized orbits and\nquantized gravitational radiation. Since some theories speculate that the early\nuniverse may have existed in n-dimensional space, certain results will be\npresented both for general n-space and for the 3-space in which we live.

Many-body luminescence from highly excited\nquantum-confined structures is conceptually important topic since a new\nparameter, a level spacing, plays a crucial role. This spacing is not merely a\ndiscretization of the bulk luminescence spectrum, as it could seem. The\ninterplay of finite spacing with interactions (even weak) results in a highly\nnontrivial sequence of emission lines, their heights revealing the many-body\ncorrelations in the system. Here the complex structure of the emission\nspectrum, resulting from the shakeup processes in many-particle (but finite)\nsystem, is demonstrated for a confined electron-hole system of a particular\ngeometry, in which the interacting carriers are confined to a ring. For this\ngeometry, the Luttinger liquid theory allows one to exactly calculate the\nintensities of all many-body spectral lines. The positions of the lines are\ngoverned by the relation of the level spacings for electrons and holes. While\nclose to the emission threshold the interactions cause only weak shakeup\nsatellites of the single-particle lines, away from the threshold the discrete\nluminescence spectrum is completely dominated by the many-body transitions. We\ndescribe the Luttinger liquid approach for calculations of optical spectra in\nfinite one-dimensional systems.

We repeat the same analysis for\n$\\omega^{2\\alpha}[\\chi^{(3)}(3\\omega; \\omega, \\omega ,\\omega)]^{2}$ and show\nthat a larger number of independent K-K relations connect the real and the\nimaginary part of the function under examination. We also compute the sum rules\nfor the suitable moments of the real and imaginary parts, and observe that only\nconsidering higher powers of the susceptibility the correct vanishing sum rules\nare more precisely obeyed. Sum rules providing explicit information about\nstructural properties of the material seem to require wider spectral range.\nThese constraints are expected to hold for any material and provide fundamental\ntests of self-consistency that any experimental or model generated data have to\nobey.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Feb 2003 16:18:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Accepted by Proteins","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"physics.bio-ph q-bio","license":null,"abstract":"  Protein representation and potential function are essential ingredients for\nstudying proteins folding and protein prediction. We introduce a novel\ngeometric representation of contact interactions using the edge simplices from\nalpha shape of protein structure. This representation can eliminate implausible\nneighbors not in physical contact, and can avoid spurious contact between two\nresidues when a third residue is between them. We develop statistical alpha\ncontact potential. A studentized bootstrap method is then introduced for\nassessing the 95% confidence intervals for each of the 210 parameters. We found\nwith confidence that there is significant long range propensity (>30 residues\napart) for hydrophobic interactions. We test alpha contact potential for native\nstructure discrimination using several decoy sets, and found it often has\ncomparable performance with atom-based potentials requiring more parameters. We\nalso show that alpha contact potential has better performance than potential\ndefined by cut-off distance between geometric centers of side chains.\nClustering of alpha contact potentials reveals natural grouping of residues. To\nexplore the relationship between shape representation and physicochemical\nrepresentation, we test the minimum alphabet size for structure discrimination.\nWe found that there is no significant difference in discrimination when\nalphabet size varies from 7 to 20, if geometry is represented accurately by\nalpha simplicial edges. This result suggests that the geometry of packing plays\nan important role, but the specific residue types are often interchangeable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Feb 2003 06:36:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
