Using\nthe exact geodesic equations for the Kerr metric, we calculate the trajectories\nof massive test particles, which are treated as isotropic, monochromatic\nemitters in their rest frames.

We show that both the structured jet and the uniform jet\nmodels can explain the observed properties of GRBs reasonably well. However, if\none tries to account for the properties of both XRFs and GRBs in a unified\npicture, the uniform jet model works reasonably well while the structured jet\nmodel fails utterly. The uniform jet model of XRFs and GRBs implies that most\nGRBs have very small jet opening angles (~ half a degree). This suggests that\nmagnetic fields play a crucial role in GRB jets. The model also implies that\nthe energy radiated in gamma rays is ~100 times smaller than has been thought.\nMost importantly, the model implies that there are ~10^4 -10^5 more bursts with\nvery small jet opening angles for every such burst we see. Thus the rate of\nGRBs could be comparable to the rate of Type Ic core collapse supernovae.\nAccurate, rapid localizations of many XRFs, leading to identification of their\nX-ray and optical afterglows and the determination of their redshifts, will be\nrequired in order to confirm or rule out these profound implications.

The elongation steps of the mRNA-bound ribosomes are modeled\nusing exact and asymptotic results of the totally asymmetric exclusion process\n(TASEP).Since the ribosome injection rates of the TASEP depend on the local\nconcentrations at the initiation site, a source of ribosomes emanating from the\ntermination end can feed back to the initiation site, leading to a\nself-consistent set of equations for the steady-state ribosome throughput.\nAdditional mRNA binding factors can also promote loop formation, or\ncyclization, bringing the initiation and termination sites into close\nproximity. The probability distribution of the distance between the initiation\nand termination sites is described using simple noninteracting polymer models.\nWe find that the initiation, or initial ribosome adsorption binding required\nfor maximal throughput can vary dramatically depending on certain values of the\nbulk ribosome concentration and diffusion constant.

Photoluminescence\nexcitation spectra of single CdTe quantum dots reflect two major mechanisms for\ncarrier excitation: The first, associated with the presence of sharp and\nintense lines in the spectrum, is a direct excited state ? ground state\ntransition. The second, associated with the appearance of up to four much\nbroader excitation lines, is a LO phonon-assisted absorption directly into the\nquantum dot ground states. LO phonons with energies of both quantum dots and\nZnTe barrier material are identified in the photoluminescence excitation\nspectra.

We find that for CdTe quantum dots the distribution of excited\nstates coupled to the ground states reflects the energy distribution of the\nquantum dot emission, but shifted up in energy by 100 meV. This large splitting\nbetween excited and ground states in CdTe quantum dots suggests strong spatial\nconfinement. In contrast, the LO phonon-assisted absorption shows significant\nsize selectivity.

Our attacks\ncan be used either as a known-plaintext attack or in the case where the\nplaintext has not been randomized. One of our attacks requires beamsplitters\nand the replacement of a lossy channel by a lossless one. It is successful\nprovided that the original loss in the channel is so big that Eve can obtain\n2^k copies of what Bob receives, where k is the length of the seed key\npre-shared by Alice and Bob. Substantial improvements over such an exhaustive\nkey search attack can be made, whenever a key is reused.

Therefore, as far as information-theoretic security is concerned,\noptically amplified signals necessarily degrade the security of the proposed\nscheme, when the plaintext is known or non-random.

We investigate the relation between\nthe geometric phase of the system and those of the subsystems. It is shown that\n(1) the geometric phase of cyclic entangled states with non-degenerate\neigenvalues can always be decomposed into a sum of weighted non-modular pure\nstate phases pertaining to the separable components of the Schmidt\ndecomposition, though the same cannot be said in the non-cyclic case, and (2)\nthe geometric phase of the mixed state of one subsystem is generally different\nfrom that of the entangled state even by keeping the other subsystem fixed, but\nthe two phases are the same when the evolution operator satisfies conditions\nwhere each component in the Schmidt decomposition is parallel transported.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Sep 2003 10:46:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-16"}

When restricted to N-qubit spin networks of identical\nqubit couplings, we show that 2 log_3 N is the maximal perfect communication\ndistance for hypercube geometries. Moreover, if one allows fixed but different\ncouplings between the qubits then perfect state transfer can be achieved over\narbitrarily long distances in a linear chain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Sep 2003 15:27:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 May 2004 00:14:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}
