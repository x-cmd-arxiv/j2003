For the purpose, we perform\nthree-dimensional radiation smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics calculations, where\nthe radiative transfer is solved by a direct method and also the\nnon-equilibrium chemistry of primordial gas including H$_2$ molecules is\nincorporated. Attention is concentrated on radiative transfer effects against\nUVB for the formation of subgalactic objects with $T_{\\rm vir}\\la 10^4$K. We\nconsider the reionization model with $z_{\\rm reion} \\approx 7$ and also the\nearlier reionization model ($z_{\\rm reion} \\approx 17$) inferred by the WMAP.\nWe find that the star formation is suppressed appreciably by UVB, but baryons\nat high-density peaks are self-shielded even during the reionization, forming\nsome amount of stars eventually. In that sense, the photoevaporation for\nsubgalactic systems is not so perfect as argued by one-dimensional spherical\ncalculations. The final stellar fraction depends on the collapse epoch and the\nmass of system, but almost regardless of the reionization epoch. For instance,\na few tenths of formed stars are born after the cosmic reionization in $z_{\\rm\nreion} \\approx 7$ model, while more than 90% stars are born after the\nreionization in the WMAP reionization model. Thus, effects of UVB feedback on\nthe substructure problem with CDM scenario should be evaluated with careful\ntreatment of the radiative transfer. The star clusters formed at high-density\npeaks coalesce with each other in a dissipationless fashion in a dark matter\npotential, resultantly forming a spheroidal system. As a result, these low-mass\ngalaxies have large mass-to-light ratios such as observed in dwarf spheroidals\nin the Local Group.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Sep 2003 16:20:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Using cosmological simulations, we\nconsider a maximum likelihood method to obtain constraints from this\ncomparison. In our method, measurements of the auto and cross spectra from\nobservations are compared with those from a multi-parameter grid of simulated\nmodels of the intergalactic medium. We then marginalize over nuisance\nparameters to obtain constraints on the cosmological constant. Redshift space\ndistortions due to peculiar velocities and thermal broadening, a potential\ndifficulty in applying this test, are explicitly modeled in our simulations. To\nillustrate our method, we measure the cross spectrum from a new sample of five\nclose quasar pairs, with separations of 0.5 to 3 arcmin.
