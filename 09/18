Recently, SUMER discovered with Doppler shift measurements loop\noscillations with longer periods (10-30 minutes) and relatively short damping\ntimes in hot (7 MK) loops, which seem to correspond to longitudinal slow\nmagnetoacoustic waves. In addition, propagating longitudinal waves have also\nbeen detected with EIT and TRACE in the lowest density scale height of loops\nnear sunspots.
