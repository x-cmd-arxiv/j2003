Here we study the consequences of taking the bounds on\n$\\Omega_{0}$ given by inflationary models, i.e. $|\\Omega_0 - 1| \\ll 1$. We show\nthat in this limit, a generic detectable non-flat manifold is locally\nindistinguishable from either a cylindrical ($R^2 \\times S^1$) or toroidal ($R\n\\times T^2$) manifold, irrespective of its global shape, with the former being\nmore likely. Importantly this is compatible with some recent indications based\non the analysis of high resolution CMB data. It also implies that in this limit\nan observer would not be able to distinguish topologically whether the universe\nis spherical, hyperbolic or flat. By severely restricting the expected\ntopological signatures of detectable isometries, our results provide an\neffective theoretical framework for interpreting cosmological observations, and\ncan be used to confine any parameter space which realistic search strategies,\nsuch as the `circles in the sky' method, need to concentrate on. This is\nparticularly important in the inflationary limit, where the precise nature of\ncosmic topology becomes undecidable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Sep 2003 17:46:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Y. Roichman has recently discovered a rule for the\nKazhdan-Lusztig characters of q-Hecke algebras of type A, which can also be\nused for the character table of S_n. For each of the two rules, we give an\nalgorithm for computing entries in the character table of S_n. We then analyze\nthe computational complexity of the two algorithms, and in the case of\ncharacters indexed by partitions in the (k,l)-hook, compare their complexities\nto each other. It turns out that the algorithm based on the Murnaghan-Nakayama\nrule requires far less operations than the other algorithm. We note the\nalgorithms' complexities' relation to two enumeration problems of Young\ndiagrams and Young tableaux.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Sep 2003 09:57:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
