From extensive MD simulations, we\nshow that this fragile-to-strong crossover (FSC) can be connected to changes in\nthe properties of the potential energy landscape, or surface (PES), of the\nliquid. To achieve this, we use thermodynamic integration to evaluate the\nabsolute free energy of the liquid over a wide range of density and $T$. We use\nthis free energy data, along with the concept of ``inherent structures'' of the\nPES, to evaluate the absolute configurational entropy $S_c$ of the liquid. We\nfind that the temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient and of $S_c$\nare consistent with the prediction of Adam and Gibbs, including in the region\nwhere we observe the FSC to occur. We find that the FSC is related to a change\nin the properties of the PES explored by the liquid, specifically an inflection\nin the $T$ dependence of the average inherent structure energy. In addition, we\nfind that the high $T$ behavior of $S_c$ suggests that the liquid entropy might\napproach zero at finite $T$, behavior associated with the so-called Kauzmann\nparadox. However, we find that the change in the PES that underlies the FSC is\nassociated with a change in the $T$ dependence of $S_c$ that elucidates how the\nKauzmann paradox is avoided in this system.

For this purpose a number of group integrals are calculated in terms\nof Toeplitz determinants. As generating functions these group integrals allow\nthe calculation of all matrix elements appearing in variational glueball mass\ncalculations in 2+1 dimensions. Making use of these analytic techniques,\nglueball masses in various symmetry sectors are calculated with N as large as\n25 allowing extrapolations to infinite N to be performed. We finish with a\nfeasibility study of applying analytic Hamiltonian techniques in 3+1\ndimensional calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Sep 2003 05:07:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In\nHRM, a quark of one nucleon knocked-out by the incoming photon rescatters with\na quark of the other nucleon leading to the production of two nucleons with\nhigh relative momentum. Summation of all relevant quark rescattering amplitudes\nallows us to express the scattering amplitude of the reaction through the\nconvolution of a hard photon-quark interaction vertex, the large angle p-n\nscattering amplitude and the low momentum deuteron wave function. Within HRM,\nit is demonstrated that the polarization observables in hard\nphotodisintegration of the deuteron can be expressed through the five helicity\namplitudes of NN scattering at high momentum transfer. At 90$^\\circ$ CM\nscattering HRM predicts the dominance of the isovector channel of hard $pn$\nrescattering, and it explains the observed smallness of induced, $P_y$ and\ntransfered, $C_x$ polarizations without invoking the argument of helicity\nconservation. Namely, HRM predicts that $P_y$ and $C_x$ are proportional to the\n$\\phi_5$ helicity amplitude which vanishes at $\\theta_{cm}=90^\\circ$ due to\nsymmetry reasons. HRM predicts also a nonzero value for $C_z$ in the\nhelicity-conserving regime and a positive $\\Sigma$ asymmetry which is related\nto the dominance of the isovector channel in the hard reinteraction. We extend\nour calculations to the region where large polarization effects are observed in\n$pp$ scattering as well as give predictions for angular dependences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Sep 2003 21:48:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
