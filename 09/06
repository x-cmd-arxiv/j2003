Hence NGC4051 is\nemitting at \\sim30% L_{Edd}.

Variations in\ndifferent wavebands are very coherent at long Fourier periods but the coherence\ndecreases at shorter periods and as the energy separation between bands\nincreases. This behaviour is similar to that of GBHs and suggests a radial\ndistribution of frequencies and photon energies with higher energies and higher\nfrequencies being associated with smaller radii [ABRIDGED].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Sep 2003 16:09:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Past\nstudies have only provided analytical predictions for the beamed\ncharacteristics of populations in which all jets have the same Lorentz factor.\nHowever, the jets found in active galaxies are known to span a large range of\nspeeds. Here we derive analytical expressions for the expected Doppler factor\ndistributions and apparent (beamed) luminosity functions of randomly-oriented,\ntwo-sided jet populations which have bulk Lorentz factors distributed according\nto a simple power-law over a range [G1, G2]. We find that if a jet population\nhas a uniform or inverted Lorentz factor distribution, its Doppler factor\ndistribution and beamed luminosity function will be very similar to that of a\njet population with Lorentz factors all equal to G2. In particular, the beamed\nand intrinsic luminosity functions will have the same slope at high\nluminosities. In the case of a steeply declining Lorentz factor distribution,\nthe slopes at high luminosities will also be identical, but only up to an\napparent luminosity equivalent to the upper cutoff of the intrinsic luminosity\nfunction. Also, at very high apparent luminosities, the slope will be\nproportional to the power law slope of the Lorentz factor distribution. At very\nlow luminosities, the form of the apparent luminosity function is very\nsensitive to the lower cutoff and steepness of the Lorentz factor distribution.\nWe discuss how it should be possible to recover useful information about the\nintrinsic luminosity functions of relativistic jets by studying flux-limited\nsamples selected on the basis of beamed jet emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Sep 2003 16:46:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We compare the observed distribution of fundamentalized periods against\nthe predictions of synthetic HBs. The observed distribution shows a sharp peak\nat P_f ~ 0.55 d, which is primarily due to the RRab variables, whereas the\nmodel predictions instead indicate that the distribution should be more uniform\nin P_f, with a buildup of variables with shorter periods (P_f < 0.5 d).\nDetailed statistical tests show, for the first time, that the observed and\npredicted distributions are incompatible with one another at a high\nsignificance level.
