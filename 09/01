Hence this setup allows us to study how the relaxation\ndynamics is affected by the pure effect of confinement, i.e. if structural\nchanges are completely avoided. We find that the local relaxation dynamics is a\nstrong function of z, the distance of the particles from the wall, and that\nclose to the surface the typical relaxation times are orders of magnitude\nlarger than the ones in the bulk. Because of the cooperative nature of the\nparticle dynamics, the slow dynamics also affects the dynamics of the particles\nfor large values of z. Using various empirical laws, we are able to\nparameterize accurately the z-dependence of the generalized incoherent\nintermediate scattering function F_s(q,z,t) and also the spatial dependence of\nstructural relaxation times. These laws allow us to determine various dynamical\nlength scales and we find that their temperature dependence is compatible with\nan Arrhenius law. Furthermore, we find that at low temperatures time and space\ndependent correlation function fulfill a generalized factorization property\nsimilar to the one predicted by mode-coupling theory for bulk systems.

In related organic charge transfer complexes, cooling at ambient\npressure increases the ionicity $\\rho$ in strikingly different ways, and is\nsometimes accompanied by a dielectric peak, that we relate to lattice\nstiffness, to structural and energetic disorder, and to the softening of the\nPeierls mode in the far-IR. The position operator $P$ for systems with periodic\nboundary conditions makes possible a systematic treatment of electron-phonon\ninteractions in extended donor-acceptor stacks in terms of correlated\nPeierls-Hubbard models. The IR intensity of the Peierls mode peaks at the\nPeierls transition at small $\\rho < 1/2$ in soft lattices, where the dielectric\nconstant also has a large peak. In dimerized stacks, the IR intensity of\ntotally symmetric, Raman active, molecular vibrations is related to charge\nfluctuations that modulate site energies. Combination bands of molecular and\nPeierls modes are identified in regular TTF-CA stacks above Tc. Energetic\ndisorder can suppress the Peierls transition and rationalize a continuous\ncrossover from small to large $\\rho$. The TTF-CA scenario of a neutral-regular\nto ionic-dimerized transition must be broadened considerably in view of charge\ntransfer salts that dimerize on the neutral side, that become ionic without a\nstructural change, or that show vibrational evidence for dimerization at\nconstant $\\rho < 1$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Sep 2003 13:26:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We show that kink\nconfigurations employing Higgs fields in the 45 (the adjoint representation) of\nO(10) break up into three classes: those that at finite distances from the wall\nrespect a U(5) subgroup of SO(10), and two others that respect the smaller\nsubgroups U(3) x U(2) and U(4) x U(1). These smaller subgroups arise from the\nclash of symmetries mechanism: they are the intersections of two differently\nembedded U(5) subgroups of SO(10), the latter being the symmetries respected in\nasymptotia on opposite sides of the domain wall. The existence of the SO(10) ->\nU(3) x U(2) = SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) x U(1)' = G_{SM} x U(1)' class advances the\nsearch for a realistic brane world model wherein some of the required symmetry\nbreaking is achieved via the clash of symmetries rather than the conventional\nmechanism. At the centres of the walls, the unbroken symmetries are enhanced.\nIn the U(3) x U(2) case, the symmetry is O(6) x U(2), which is closely related\nto the Pati-Salam-like SU(4) x SU(2) x U(1) group. If our universe is a brane\nlocated at the centre of such a wall, then we see the O(10) symmetry as being\nstrongly broken to SU(4) x SU(2) x U(1). Interestingly, if the brane-world\ndegrees of freedom enjoy a slight leakage off the wall, then an additional\nsymmetry breakdown to U(3) x U(2) = G_{SM} x U(1)' is effectively induced on\nthe brane. This provides a possible framework within which to address at least\npart of a gauge hierarchy problem: O(10) is strongly broken to SU(4) x SU(2) x\nU(1), then more weakly to G_{SM} x U(1)' depending on the amount of leakage off\nthe brane.

Since\nthese observables are affected significantly by colour-allowed electroweak (EW)\npenguins, this ``B -> pi K puzzle'' could be a manifestation of new physics in\nthe EW penguin sector. Performing the analysis in the R_n-R_c plane, which is\nvery suitable for monitoring various effects, we demonstrate that we may, in\nfact, move straightforwardly to the experimental region in this plane through\nan enhancement of the relevant EW penguin parameter q. We derive analytical\nbounds for q in terms of a quantity L, that measures the violation of the\nLipkin sum rule, and point out that strong phases around 90 deg are favoured by\nthe data, in contrast to QCD factorisation. The B -> pi K modes imply a\ncorrelation between q and the angle gamma that in the limit of negligible\nrescattering effects and colour suppressed EW penguins depends only on the\nvalue of L. Concentrating on a minimal flavour-violating new-physics scenario\nwith enhanced Z^0 penguins, we find that the current experimental values on\n  B -> X_s mu^+ mu^- require roughly L <= 1.8. As the B -> pi K data give L =\n5.7 +- 2.4, L has either to move to smaller values once the B -> pi K data\nimprove or new sources of flavour and CP violation are needed. In turn, the\nenhanced values of L seen in the B -> pi K data could be accompanied by\nenhanced branching ratios for rare decays. Most interesting turns out to be the\ncorrelation between the B -> pi K modes and BR(K^+ -> pi^+ nu nu), with the\nlatter depending approximately on a single ``scaling'' variable \\bar L= L\n(|V_{ub}/V_{cb}|/0.086)^2.3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Sep 2003 15:12:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Sep 2003 14:43:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}

For this we calculate scalar metric fluctuations around\nfive dimensional warped geometry with four dimensional de Sitter slices. The\nbackground metric is determined self-consistently by the (arbitrary) bulk\nscalar field potential, supplemented by the boundary conditions at both\norbifold branes. Assuming that the inflating branes are stabilized (by the\nbrane scalar field potentials), we estimate the lowest eigenvalue of the scalar\nfluctuations - the radion mass. In the limit of flat branes, we reproduce well\nknown estimates of the positive radion mass for stabilized branes.\nSurprisingly, however, we found that for de Sitter (inflating) branes the\nsquare of the radion mass is typically negative, which leads to a strong\ntachyonic instability. Thus, parameters of stabilized inflating braneworlds\nmust be constrained to avoid this tachyonic instability. Instability of\n\"stabilized\" de Sitter branes is confirmed by the BraneCode numerical\ncalculations in the accompanying paper hep-th/0309001. If the model's\nparameters are such that the radion mass is smaller than the Hubble parameter,\nwe encounter a new mechanism of generation of primordial scalar fluctuations,\nwhich have a scale free spectrum and acceptable amplitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Sep 2003 07:02:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The inverse problem of finding the field that generates a specific\nunitary transformation is the subject of study. The unitary transformation\nwhich can represent an algorithm in a quantum computation is imposed on a\nsubset of quantum states embedded in a larger Hilbert space. Optimal control\ntheory (OCT) is used to solve the inversion problem irrespective of the initial\ninput state. A unified formalism, based on the Krotov method is developed\nleading to a new scheme. The schemes are compared for the inversion of a\ntwo-qubit Fourier transform using as registers the vibrational levels of the\n$X^1\\Sigma^+_g$ electronic state of Na$_2$. Raman-like transitions through the\n$A^1\\Sigma^+_u$ electronic state induce the transitions. Light fields are found\nthat are able to implement the Fourier transform within a picosecond time\nscale.
