In addition to bright diffuse emission, we resolve 165 discrete\nsources, most of which are presumably low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). As found\nin previous studies, the luminosity function of the resolved sources is\nwell-fit by a broken power-law. In NGC4697 and NGC1553, the break luminosity\nwas comparable to the Eddington luminosity of a $1.4 M_{\\odot}$ neutron star.\nOne possible interpretation of this result is that those sources with\nluminosities above the break are accreting black holes and those below are\nmainly accreting neutron stars. The total X-ray spectrum of the resolved\nsources is well-fit by a hard power-law, while the diffuse spectrum requires a\nhard and a soft component, presumably due to the relatively soft diffuse gas\nand the harder unresolved sources. We also find evidence for structure in the\ndiffuse emission near the center of NGC4649. Specifically, there appear to be\nbright \"fingers\" of emission extending from the center of the galaxy and a 5\narcsec long bar at the center of the galaxy. The fingers are morphologically\nsimilar to radial features seen in two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of\ncooling flows in elliptical galaxies, and although their other properties do\nnot match the predictions of the particular simulations used we conclude that\nthe radial fingers might be due to convective motions of hot outflowing gas and\ncooler inflowing gas.

In this paper the micro-physics of this process is\ntreated in detail, with an emphasis on the effects of drift (drift models). We\nsummarize the description of the dust formation process and make a few\nadditions to previous work. A detailed study shows that different growth\nspecies dominate the grain growth rates at different drift velocities. The new\nmodels show that the net effect of drift is to significantly increase the\namounts of dust, seemingly without affecting the mean wind properties, such as\ne.g., the mass loss rate. In some cases there is several times more dust in\ndrift models, compared to the values in the corresponding non-drift models. We\nstudy the formation of a dust shell in the inner parts of the wind and find\nthat drift plays an active role in accumulating dust to certain narrow regions.\nIn view of the results presented here it is questionable if drift -- under the\ncurrent assumptions -- can be ignored in the grain growth rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Sep 2003 15:26:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Yet, there is no\nsimple explanation for this state. In this article we advance and explore the\npremise that the dynamics of the universe always seeks equilibrium conditions.\nVacuum-induced cosmic accelerations lead to creation of matter-energy modes at\nthe expense of vacuum energy. Because they gravitate, such modes constitute\ninertia against cosmic acceleration. On the other extreme, the would-be\nultimate phase of local gravitational collapse is checked by a phase transition\nin the collapsing matter fields leading to a de Sitter-like fluid deep inside\nthe black hole horizon, and at the expense of the collapsing matter fields. As\na result, the universe succumbs to neither vacuum-induced run-away\naccelerations nor to gravitationally induced spacetime curvature singularities.\nCosmic dynamics is self-regulating. We discuss the physical basis for these\nconstraints and the implications, pointing out how the framework relates and\nhelps resolve standing puzzles such as \"why did cosmic inflation end?\", \"why is\nLambda small now?\" and \"why does the universe appear persistently critical?\".\nThe approach does, on the one hand, suggest a future course for cosmic\ndynamics, while on the other hand it provides some insight into the physics\ninside black hole horizons. The interplay between the background vacuum and\nmatter fields suggests an underlying symmetry that links spacetime acceleration\nwith spacetime collapse and global (cosmic) dynamics with local (black hole)\ndynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Sep 2003 12:36:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In\nthis paper we consider two kinds of such ``brane defects'', which are formed by\nthe local fluctuations of the locations of branes along their transversal\ndirections. The fluctuation of a brane position might leads to winding (or\nwraping) around a non-contractible circle of the compactified space.

On the\nother hand, if there are multiple branes in the compactified space and their\nconfiguration in a compactified space is determined by the potential that\ndepends only on their relative positions, one might find incidental symmetry in\nthe effective potential, which is spontaneously broken by branes.
