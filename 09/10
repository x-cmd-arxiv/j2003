This result is unchanged if we consider mergers\nwith parent mass ratios of 3:1 instead of 1:1. Mergers of a cuspy halo with\neither a cored halo or a second cuspy halo of equal mass, on the other hand,\nproduce cuspy haloes with a slightly reduced inner logarithmic slope. Cuspy\nhaloes, once formed, therefore appear resilient to major mergers.

In a purely fermionic language proceeding\ninto the SSB phase requires techniques beyond perturbation theory and\nrenormalization group equations. Improvement comes from a description with BBS\nfields and elementary fields treated on equal footing. Yet, ``partial\nbosonization'' introduces an arbitrariness as the choice for the composite\nfields is usually not completely determined by the classical action. Results of\napproximate calculations, e.g. mean field theory, may depend strongly on this\nchoice, thus limiting their quantitative reliability. Using the\nNambu--Jona-Lasinio model as an example we demonstrate how this dependence can\nbe reduced, sometimes even be eliminated by suitably chosen approximations.\n  Schwinger-Dyson equations (SDE) allow for a description of SSB without\nauxiliary fields. The 2PI effective action enables us to compare different\nsolutions of the SDE and find the stable one. We apply this method to a\nsix-fermion interaction resembling the three-flavor instanton interaction in\nQCD. We find a first order chiral phase transition but no stable phase with\nbroken color symmetry.\n  The existence of an elementary scalar boson in the Standard Model -- the\nHiggs -- raises several questions. The smallness of its mass compared to some\nfundamental scale ($\\sim M_{\\textrm{GUT}}$) requires an extreme amount of\nfine-tuning. Moreover, its $\\phi^4$-potential may not be renormalizable in a\nstrict sense. In view of this we discuss the possibility of a Higgs as BBS of\nfermions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Sep 2003 19:27:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In this article, we study the problem from two different\npoints of view. First, we systematically review various physical reasons why\nthis inharmonicity may take place, and the effect of different bore\nperturbations inserted in cylindrical instruments. Applications to a real\nclarinet resonator and comparisons with impedance measurements are then\npresented. A commonly accepted idea is that the register hole is the dominant\ncause for this inharmonicity: it is natural to expect that opening this hole\nwill raise the resonance frequencies of the instrument, except for the note for\nwhich the hole is at the pressure node. We show that the real situation is\nactually more complicated because other effects, such as open holes or bore\ntaper and bell, introduce resonance shifts that are comparable but with\nopposite sign, so that a relatively good overall compensation takes place. The\norigin of the observed inharmonicity in playing frequencies is therefore\ndifferent. In a second part, we use an elementary model of the clarinet in\norder to isolate the effect of the register hole: a perfect cylindrical tube\nwithout closed holes. Optimization techniques are then used to calculate an\noptimum location for the register hole; the result turns out to be close to the\nlocation chosen by clarinet makers.
