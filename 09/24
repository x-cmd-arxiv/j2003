The Eulerian fluid conservation equations are solved in an\nadaptive frame moving with the fluid where Mach numbers are minimized. The\nmoving frame approach uses a velocity decomposition technique to define local\nkinetic variables while storing the bulk kinetic components in a smoothed\nbackground velocity field that is associated with the grid velocity.\nGravitationally induced accelerations are added to the grid, thereby minimizing\nthe spurious heating problem encountered in cold gas flows. Separately tracking\nlocal and bulk flow components allows thermodynamic variables to be accurately\ncalculated in both subsonic and supersonic regions. A main feature of the\nalgorithm, that is not possible in previous Eulerian implementations, is the\nability to resolve shocks and prevent spurious heating where both the preshock\nand postshock Mach numbers are high. The hybrid algorithm combines the high\nresolution shock capturing ability of the second-order accurate Eulerian TVD\nscheme with a low-diffusion Lagrangian advection scheme. We have implemented a\ncosmological code where the hydrodynamic evolution of the baryons is captured\nusing the moving frame algorithm while the gravitational evolution of the\ncollisionless dark matter is tracked using a particle-mesh N-body algorithm.\nThe MACH code is highly suited for simulating the evolution of the IGM where\naccurate thermodynamic evolution is needed for studies of the Lyman alpha\nforest, the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, and the X-ray background. Hydrodynamic\nand cosmological tests are described and results presented. The current code is\nfast, memory-friendly, and parallelized for shared-memory machines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Sep 2003 19:00:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Sep 2003 19:46:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The cosmic ray\ntransport is described by the diffusion-advection equation. The applied form of\nthe diffusion tensor allows for anisotropic diffusion of cosmic rays along and\nacross the magnetic field direction, which is controlled by two parameters: the\nparallel and perpendicular diffusion coefficients. The implemented numerical\nalgorithm is tested by comparison of the diffusive transport of cosmic rays to\nanalytical solutions of the diffusion equation. Our method is numerically\nstable for a wide range of diffusion coefficients, including the realistic\nvalues inferred from the observational data for the Milky Way of about $ 6\n\\times 10^{28} \\cm^2 \\s^{-1}$. The presented algorithm is applied for exemplary\nsimulations of the the Parker instability triggered by cosmic rays injected by\na single SN remnant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Sep 2003 08:32:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

If, for example the energy is chosen to be E=-s_{max}, the observed\ntransition is analogous to the percolation phase transition of random graphs.\nFor this choice of the energy, the phase-diagram in the [<k>,T] plane is\nconstructed. Single vertex energies of the form\n  E=sum_i f(k_i), where k_i is the degree of vertex i, are also studied.\nDepending on the form of f(k_i), first order and continuous phase transitions\ncan be observed.

As a consequence of this approach, a wave function of the Universe\ndepends not only on physical fields but also on gauge degrees of freedom. From\nthis viewpoint, one should regard the physical Universe as a subsystem whose\nproperties are formed in interaction with the subsystem of gauge degrees of\nfreedom.
