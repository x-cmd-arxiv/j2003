Here\nwe systematically investigate how the changes of the parameters of this\npotential affect the phase diagram of the system. We find a broad range of\npotential parameters for which the system has both a gas-liquid critical point\nand a liquid-liquid critical point.

However,\nfor small m_K, we find no S=+1 kaon bound states or resonances in the spectrum,\nconfirming previous work. This suggests that, at least for large N and small\nm_K, the exotic state may be an artifact of the rigid rotator approach to the\nSkyrme model.

The ELSV formula relates\nsingle Hurwitz numbers to intersection theory on the moduli space of curves,\nand has led to many consequences.\n  We determine the structure of double Hurwitz numbers using geometry, algebra,\nand representation theory.

These\nconstraints pump energy into a system, hence there must be some thermal\nreservoir that prevents the system from heating up.

This approach yielded\nsimple relations between fundamental quantities of nonequilibrium statistical\nmechanics and of dynamical systems theory. The main theme of our review is to\ncritically assess the universality of these results. As a vehicle of\ndemonstration we employ the driven periodic Lorentz gas, which is a toy model\nfor the classical dynamics of an electron in a metal under application of an\nelectric field. Applying different types of thermal reservoirs to this system\nwe compare the resulting nonequilibrium steady states with each other.

We consider the population\ndynamics when the oasis is moving, or equivalently some form of \"wind\" is\nblowing the population away from the oasis. We find that the ratio of the two\ntypes of individuals exhibits sharp transitions at particular oasis velocities.\nWe calculate an extinction velocity, and a switching velocity above which the\ndominance switches from the oasis-adapted genotype to the desert-adapted one.\nThis switching velocity is analagous to the quasispecies mutational error\nthreshold.

We introduce here a modelling framework based on a key\nanalogy of the physico-chemical properties of the exon1 fragment to block\ncopolymers. We use a systematic mesoscale methodology, based on Dissipative\nParticle Dynamics, which is capable of overcoming kinetic barriers, thus\ncapturing the dynamics of significantly larger systems over longer times than\nconsidered before. Our results reveal that the relative hydrophobicity of the\npoly-glutamine block as compared to the rest of the (proline-based) exon1\nfragment, ignored to date, constitutes a major factor in the initiation of the\nself-assembly process. We find that the assembly is governed by both the\nconcentration of exon1 and the length of the poly-glutamine stretch, with a low\nlength threshold for association even at the lowest volume fractions we\nconsidered. Moreover, this self-association occurs irrespective of whether the\nglutamine stretch is in random coil or hairpin configuration, leading to\nspherical or cylindrical assemblies, respectively. We discuss the implications\nof these results for reinterpretation of existing research within this context,\nincluding that the routes towards aggregation of exon1 may be distinct to those\nof the widely studied homopolymeric poly-glutamine peptides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Sep 2003 22:26:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
