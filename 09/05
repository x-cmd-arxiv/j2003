Dynamics is governed by an extension of Newton's second law.\nIn the static case, geodesic motion is recovered together with Newton's\nattraction field. In the static spherical case, Schwarzschild's metric is got.\nAn asymptotic scheme of post-Minkowskian (PM) approximation is built by\nassociating a conceptual family of systems with the given weakly-gravitating\nsystem. It is more general than the post-Newtonian scheme in that the velocity\nmay be comparable with $c$. This allows to justify why the 0PM approximation of\nthe energy rate may be equated to the rate of the Newtonian energy, as is\nusually done. At the 0PM approximation of this theory, an isolated system loses\nenergy by quadrupole radiation, without any monopole or dipole term. It seems\nplausible that the observations on binary pulsars (the pulse data) could be\nnicely fitted with a timing model based on this theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Sep 2003 13:52:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-11-19"}

The\npaper first shows explicitly that, along with the momentum representation,\nthere is room in the one photon Hilbert space for an alternative position\nrepresentation. This is made possible by the existence of a self-adjoint,\ninvolutive, position operator conjugate to the momentum operator (due to M.\nHawton). Position and momenta are shown to satisfy the Heisenberg-Weyl\nquantization rules in the helicity basis, which is analyzed anew from this\npoint of view. The paper then turns to the photon's time of arrival. By picking\nan appropriate photon Hamiltonian - using Maxwell equations as the photon\nSchroedinger equation - a conjugate time of arrival operator is built. Its\ninterpretation, including the probability densities for the instant of arrival\n(at arbitrary points of 3-D space) of photon states with different helicities\ncoming from arbitrary places, is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Sep 2003 16:11:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
