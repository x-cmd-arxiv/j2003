Our method is iterative and operates\nin probability space. Once a stable probability solution is found we find the\ntrue combinatorial solution from the probabilities. For system sizes which are\namenable to exact solution by conventional means, we find a correct minimum\nvertex cover for all cases which we have tested, which include random graphs\nand diluted triangular lattices of up to 100 sites. We present precise data for\nminimum vertex cover on graphs of up to 50,000 sites. Extensions of the method\nto hard core lattices gases and other NP problems are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Sep 2003 18:01:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
