Our results clearly show\nthat in the antiferromagnetic phase Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM)superexchange\ncauses Cu spin canting not only in the LTO phase but also in the LTLO and LTT\nphases. In La1.8Eu0.2CuO4 the canted DM-moment is about 50% larger than in pure\nLa2CuO4 which we attribute to the larger octahedral tilt angle. We also find\nclear evidence that the size of the DM-moment does not change significantly at\nthe structural transition at T_LT from LTO to LTLO and LTT. The most important\nchange induced by the transition is a significant reduction of the magnetic\ncoupling between the CuO2 planes. As a consequence, the spin-flip transition of\nthe canted Cu spins which is observed in the LTO phase for magnetic field\nperpendicular to the CuO2 planes disappears in the LTT phase. The shape of the\nmagnetization curves changes from the well known spin-flip type to a\nweak-ferromagnet type. However, no spontaneous weak ferromagnetism is observed\neven at very low temperatures, which seems to indicate that the interlayer\ndecoupling in our samples is not perfect. Nonetheless, a small fraction (<15%)\nof the DM-moments can be remanently magnetized throughout the entire\nantiferromagnetically ordered LTT/LTLO phase, i.e. for T<T_LT and x<0.02.

However, this model\nis unclear for an atomic interferometer demonstrated recently by Shahriar et\nal., for which the atom simply passes through a single-zone optical beam,\nconsisting of a pair of bichromatic counter-propagating beams. During the\npassage, the atomic wave packets in two distinct internal states couple to each\nother continuously. The two internal states trace out a complicated trajectory,\nguided by the optical beams, with the amplitude and spread of each wavepacket\nvarying continuously. Yet, at the end of the single-zone excitation, there is\nan interference with fringe amplitudes that can reach a visibility close to\nunity. For such a situation, it is not clear how one would define the area of\nthe interferometer, and therefore, what the rotation sensitivity of such an\ninterferometer would be. In this paper we analyze this interferometer in order\nto determine its rotation sensitivity, and thereby determine its effective\narea. In many ways, the continuous interferometer (CI) can be thought of as a\nlimiting version of the Borde-Chu Interferometer (BCI). We identify a quality\nfactor that can be used to compare the performance of these interferometers.\nUnder conditions of practical interest, we show that the rotation sensitivity\nof the CI can be comparable to that of the BCI. The relative simplicity of the\nCI (e.g., elimination of the task of precise angular alignment of the three\nzones) then makes it a potentially better candidate for practical atom\ninterferometry for rotation sensing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Sep 2003 11:00:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The algorithm is applied to a random binary\noptimization problem (a version of the 3-Satisfiability problem) where the\nn-bit cost function is symmetric with respect to the permutation of individual\nbits. The evolution paths are produced, using the generic control Hamiltonians\nH(\\tau) that preserve the bit symmetry of the underlying optimization problem.\nIn the case where the ground state of H(0) coincides with the totally-symmetric\nstate of an n-qubit system the algorithm dynamics is completely described in\nterms of the motion of a spin-n/2.\n  We show that different control Hamiltonians can be parameterized by a set of\nindependent parameters that are expansion coefficients of H(\\tau) in a certain\nuniversal set of operators. Only one of these operators can be responsible for\navoiding the tunnelling in the spin-n/2 system during the quantum adiabatic\nalgorithm. We show that it is possible to select a coefficient for this\noperator that guarantees a polynomial complexity of the algorithm for all\nproblem instances. We show that a successful evolution path of the algorithm\nalways corresponds to the trajectory of a classical spin-n/2 and provide a\ncomplete characterization of such paths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Sep 2003 15:26:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
