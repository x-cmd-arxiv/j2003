The X-ray\nspectrum indicates the presence of an optically thin plasma in the boundary\nlayer that cools as it settles onto the white dwarf. The plasma has a\ncontinuous temperature distribution that is well described by a power-law or a\ncooling flow model with a maximum temperature of 6-8 keV. We estimate from the\nX-ray spectrum a boundary layer luminosity of 8*10^30 erg/s, which is only 20\nper cent of the disk luminosity. The rate of accretion onto the white dwarf is\n5*10^-12 solar masses per year, about half of the rate in the disk. From the\nhigh-resolution X-ray spectra, we estimate that the X-ray emitting part of the\nboundary layer is rotating with a velocity of 540 km/s, which is close the\nrotation velocity of the white dwarf but significantly smaller than the\nKeplerian velocity. We detect a 60-s quasi-periodic oscillation of the X-ray\nflux that is likely due to the rotation of the boundary layer. The X-ray and\nthe ultra-violet flux show strong variability on a time scale of ~1500 s. We\nfind that the variability in the two bands is correlated and that the X-ray\nfluctuations are delayed by ~100 s. The correlation indicates that the variable\nultra-violet flux is emitted near the transition region between the disk and\nthe boundary layer and that accretion rate fluctuations in this region are\npropagated to the X-ray emitting part of the boundary layer within ~100 s. An\norbital modulation of the X-ray flux suggests that the inner accretion disk is\ntilted with respect to the orbital plane.

While radiative cooling increases the entropy of\nintracluster gas, resulting in a good match to the data in the centres of\nclusters, it produces an entropy-temperature relation closer to the\nself-similar scaling at larger radii. A model that includes feedback from\ngalaxies, however, not only stabilises the cooling rate in the simulation, but\nis capable of reproducing the observed scaling behaviour both in cluster cores\nand at large radii. Feedback modifies the entropy distribution in clusters due\nto its increasing ability at expelling gas from haloes with decreasing mass.\nThe strength of the feedback required, as suggested from our simulations, is\nconsistent with supernova energetics, providing a large fraction of the energy\nreaches low-density regions and is originally contained within a small mass of\ngas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Sep 2003 11:57:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Nov 2003 09:55:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Superfluid turbulence was recently\nshown to have an energy spectrum consistent with the Kolmogorov law, which is\nan important statistical law in fully developed classical turbulence. We\ndescribe the diffusion of an inhomogeneous vortex tangle with relation to the\nobserved decay of vortices at very low temperatures. We also describe the\nvortex states that appear in a rotating channel with counterflow. The\ncompetition between rotational effects and counterflow effects makes a new\nstate of \"a polarized vortex tangle\". Next, we discuss recent numerical\nanalysis of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in the specific field of atomic-gas\nBose-Einstein condensation. Consistent with observations, the simulated\ncondensate starts an elliptic oscillation after the rotation is turned on,\nwhich induces the surface-mode excitations. The vortices develop from these\nsurface excitations and then enter the bulk condensate, eventually forming a\nvortex lattice.

Dynamic\ninstrumentation can already be used to analyse code which is loaded or even\ngenerated at run time.With the advent of environments such as the Java Virtual\nMachine with optimizing Just-In-Time compilers, a new obstacle arises:\nself-modifying code. In order to instrument this kind of code correctly, one\nmust be able to detect modifications and adapt the instrumentation code\naccordingly, preferably without incurring a high penalty speedwise. In this\npaper we propose an innovative technique that uses the hardware page protection\nmechanism of modern processors to detect such modifications. We also show how\nan instrumentor can adapt the instrumented version depending on the kind of\nmodificiations as well as an experimental evaluation of said techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Sep 2003 13:55:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

The\nheuristic is based on Newtonian gravity, the notion of local inertial frames\n[the Einstein equivalence principle], plus the use of Galilean coordinate\ntransformations to connect the freely falling local inertial frames back to the\n``fixed stars''. Because of the heuristic and quasi-Newtonian manner in which\nthe spacetime geometry is obtained, we are at best justified in expecting it to\nbe a weak-field approximation to the true spacetime geometry. However, in the\ncase of a spherically symmetric point mass the result is coincidentally an\nexact solution of the full vacuum Einstein field equations -- it is the\nSchwarzschild geometry in Painleve--Gullstrand coordinates.\n  This result is much stronger than the well-known result of Michell and\nLaplace whereby a Newtonian argument correctly estimates the value of the\nSchwarzschild radius -- using the heuristic presented in this article one\nobtains the entire Schwarzschild geometry. The heuristic also gives sensible\nresults -- a Riemann flat geometry -- when applied to a constant gravitational\nfield. Furthermore, a subtle extension of the heuristic correctly reproduces\nthe Reissner--Nordstrom geometry and even the de Sitter geometry. Unfortunately\nthe heuristic construction is not truly generic. For instance, it is incapable\nof generating the Kerr geometry or anti-de Sitter space.\n  Despite this limitation, the heuristic does have useful pedagogical value in\nthat it provides a simple and direct plausibility argument for the\nSchwarzschild geometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Sep 2003 03:39:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Sep 2003 20:35:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2004 02:41:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}

It is\nnot assumed that regulation is robust, nor is there a prior requirement for the\nsystem to be partitioned into separate plant and controller components.\nInstead, one assumes that a ``signal detection'' property holds.

We propose a quantum circuit design\nmethod that has the following unique feature: It allows to construct efficient\nquantum circuits in a systematic way by reusing and combining a set of highly\noptimized quantum circuits. Specifically, the method realizes a quantum circuit\nfor a given unitary matrix by implementing a linear combination of representing\nmatrices of a group, which have known fast quantum circuits. We motivate and\nillustrate this method by deriving extremely efficient quantum circuits for the\ndiscrete Hartley transform and for the fractional Fourier transforms. The sound\nmathematical basis of this design method allows to give meaningful and natural\ninterpretations of the resulting circuits. We demonstrate this aspect by giving\na natural interpretation of known teleportation circuits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Sep 2003 19:59:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Sep 2003 22:08:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
