We find that the cluster correlation strength increases with\nredshift: high redshift clusters are clustered more strongly (in comoving\nscale) than low redshift clusters of the same mass. The increased correlations\nwith redshift, in spite of the decreasing mass correlation strength, is caused\nby the strong increase in cluster bias with redshift: clusters represent higher\ndensity peaks of the mass distribution as the redshift increases. The\nrichness-dependent cluster correlation function, presented as the\ncorrelation-scale versus cluster mean separation relation, R_0 - d, is found to\nbe, remarkably, independent of redshift to z <~ 2 for LCDM and z <~ 1 for TCDM\n(for a fixed correlation function slope and cluster mass within a fixed\ncomoving radius). The non-evolving R_0 - d relation implies that both the\ncomoving clustering scale and the cluster mean separation increase with\nredshift for the same mass clusters so that the R_0 - d relation remains\nessentially unchanged. The evolution of the R_0 - d relation from z ~ 0 to z ~\n3 provides an important new tool in cosmology; it can be used to break\ndegeneracies that exist at z ~ 0 and provide precise determination of\ncosmological parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Sep 2003 18:02:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Dec 2003 01:44:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

A new general, consistent, and optimal\nchoice of parameters provides a deep understanding of the involved features,\navoids numerical difficulties and minimizes correlations between model\nparameters. While the photometric data of a microlensing event around a caustic\ncrossing itself do not provide constraints on the characteristics of the\nunderlying binary lens and does not allow predictions of the behaviour of other\nregions of the lightcurve, vital constraints can be obtained in an efficient\nway if these are combined with a few simple characteristics of data outside the\ncaustic crossings. A corresponding algorithm containing some improvements over\nan earlier approach which takes into account multi-site observations is\npresented and discussed in detail together with the arising parameter\nconstraints paying special attention to the role of source and background\nfluxes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Sep 2003 15:28:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2004 07:58:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The problem of\nreconstruction of stress tensors is crucially related to the fact that the ray\ntransform has a nontrivial kernel; the latter is described by a theorem for\nwhich we provide a new proof which is simpler and shorter as in Sharafutdinov's\noriginal work, as we limit our scope to tensors which are relevant to\nPhotoelasticity. We explain how the kernel of the ray transform is related to\nthe decomposition of tensor fields into longitudinal and transverse components.\nThe merits of the ray transform as a tool for tensor reconstruction are studied\nby walking through an explicit example of reconstructing the\n$\\sigma_{33}$-component of the stress tensor in a cylindrical photoelastic\nspecimen. In order to make the paper self-contained we provide a derivation of\nthe basic equations of Integrated Photoelasticity which describe how the\npresence of stress within a photoelastic medium influences the passage of\npolarized light through the material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Sep 2003 10:43:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
