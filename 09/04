Although the sample\nis heterogenous and incomplete, this is the first comprehensive study of the\nmid-infrared fine structure line emission of LINERs. These results have been\ncompared with similar observations of starburst galaxies and AGN. We find that\nLINERs very clearly fall between starbursts and AGN in their mid-IR fine\nstructure line spectra, showing L_[OIV]26um/L_FIR and\nL_[OIV]26um/L_[NeII]12.8um ratios, both measures of the dominant nuclear energy\nsource in dust-enshrouded galaxies, intermediate between those of AGN and\nstarbursts. Chandra imaging observations of the LINERs reveal hard nuclear\npoint sources morphologically consistent with AGN in most (67%) of the sample,\nwith a clear trend with IR-brightness. Most LINERs that show a single dominant\nhard compact X-ray core are IR-faint ((L_FIR/L_B < 1), whereas most LINERs that\nshow scattered X-ray sources are IR-bright. A comparative X-ray/mid-IR\nspectroscopic investigation of LINERs reveals some puzzling results. Objects\nthat display strong hard nuclear X-ray cores should also display high\nexcitation lines in the IR. However, we find two LINERs disagree with this\nexpectation. The galaxy NGC 404 shows weak soft X-ray emission consistent with\na starburst but has the most prominent highest excitation mid-IR spectrum of\nour entire sample. Using IR emission line diagnostics alone, this galaxy would\nbe classified as hosting a dominant AGN. Conversely, the IR luminous LINER NGC\n6240 has an extremely luminous binary AGN as revealed by the X-rays but shows\nweak IR emission lines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Sep 2003 18:48:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We then\nrecall the principles of the nonperturbative approach - the effective average\naction method - that we have used to investigate the physics of frustrated\nmagnets. First, we recall the treatment of the unfrustrated - O(N) - case with\nthis method. This allows to introduce its technical aspects. Then, we show how\nthis method unables to clarify most of the problems encountered in the previous\ntheoretical descriptions of frustrated magnets. Firstly, we get an explanation\nof the long-standing mismatch between different perturbative approaches which\nconsists in a nonperturbative mechanism of annihilation of fixed points between\ntwo and three dimensions. Secondly, we get a coherent picture of the physics of\nfrustrated magnets in qualitative and (semi-) quantitative agreement with the\nnumerical and experimental results. The central feature that emerges from our\napproach is the existence of scaling behaviors without fixed or pseudo-fixed\npoint and that relies on a slowing-down of the renormalization group flow in a\nwhole region in the coupling constants space. This phenomenon allows to explain\nthe occurence of generic weak first order behaviors and to understand the\nabsence of universality in the critical behavior of frustrated magnets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Sep 2003 10:31:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The transition rates are assumed to obey\ndetailed balance also in the presence of a field. It is shown that in general\nthe linear response cannot be expressed via time-derivatives of the correlation\nfunction alone, but an additional function $\\xi(t,t_w)$, which has been rarely\ndiscussed before is required. This function depends on the two times also\nrelevant for the response and the correlation and vanishes under equilibrium\nconditions. It can be expressed in terms of the propagators and the transition\nrates of the master equation but it is not related to any physical observable\nin an obvious way.

The solution of the FE requires\nadditional assumptions among the dynamical variables known with the generic\nname equations of state.

We find that topology indeed\ndrives chiral symmetry breaking at N=3 as well as at large N. By comparing the\nresults on various volumes and at different lattice spacings we are able to\nshow that our conclusions are not affected by finite volume effects and also\nhold in the continuum limit. We then address the question whether the topology\ncan be usefully described in terms of instantons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Sep 2003 17:30:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We\nstart by introducing a notion of a 2-cosemisimplicial object in an arbitrary\n2-category and analyzing the corresponding coherence question, where the\npermutohedra make their appearence. We then describe a general method to obtain\ncochain complexes of K-modules from (enhanced) 2-cosemisimplicial objects in\nthe 2-category ${\\bf Cat}_K$ of small $K$-linear categories and prove that the\ndeformation complex introduced in the above mentioned work can be obtained by\nthis method from a 2-cosemisimplicial object that can be associated to the\npseudofunctor. Finally, using a generalization to the context of $K$-linear\ncategories of the deviation calculus introduced by Markl and Stasheff for\n$K$-modules (J. Algebra 170 (1994) 122), it is shown that the obstructions to\nthe integrability of an $n^{th}$-order deformation of a pseudofunctor indeed\ncorrespond to cocycles in the third cohomology group, a question which remained\nopen in our previous work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Sep 2003 12:07:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2004 13:44:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-13"}

The basic idea is that one\ncan associate to certain sorts of degenerations of Calabi-Yau manifolds a log\nCalabi-Yau space, which is a log structure on the degenerate fibre. Then many\nstatements about mirror symmetry which one hopes to be true for the general\nfibre should first be proved for this log CY space. In this paper we begin by\ndiscussing affine manifolds with singularities. Given such an affine manifold\nalong with a polyhedral decomposition, we show how to construct a scheme\nconsisting of a union of toric varieties. In certain non-degenerate cases, we\ncan also construct log structures on these schemes. Conversely, given certain\nsorts of degenerations, one can build an affine manifold with singularities\nstructure on the dual intersection complex of the degeneration. Mirror symmetry\nis then obtained as a discrete Legendre transform on these affine manifolds,\nthus providing an algebro-geometrization of the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow\nconjecture.

We constructed a prototype Cherenkov counter using a 4 x 4 array\nof 64-channel flat-panel multi-anode PMTs (Hamamatsu H8500) with a large\neffective area. The aerogel samples were made with a new technique to obtain a\nhigher transmission length at a high refractive index (n=1.05). Multi-channel\nPMTs are read-out with analog memory chips. The detector was tested at the\nKEK-PS pi2 beam line in November, 2002. To evaluate systematically the\nperformance of the detector, tests were carried out with various aerogel\nsamples using pion beams with momenta between 0.5 GeV/c and 4 GeV/c. The\ntypical angular resolution was around 14 mrad, and the average number of\ndetected photoelectrons was around 6. We expect that pions and kaons can be\nseparated at a 4 sigma level at 4 GeV/c.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Sep 2003 15:53:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Nov 2003 12:26:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

In\nparticular, entanglement shared between two distant parties allows them to do\ncertain tasks that would otherwise be impossible. In this context, we study the\neffect on the available entanglement of physical restrictions on the local\noperations that can be performed by the two parties. We enforce these physical\nrestrictions by generalized superselection rules (SSRs), which we define to be\nassociated with a given group of physical transformations. Specifically the\ngeneralized SSR is that the local operations must be covariant with respect to\nthat group. Then we operationally define the entanglement constrained by a SSR,\nand show that it may be far below that expected on the basis of a naive (or\n``fluffy bunny'') calculation. We consider two examples. The first is a\nparticle number SSR. Using this we show that for a two-mode BEC (with Alice\nowning mode $A$ and Bob mode $B$), the useful entanglement shared by Alice and\nBob is identically zero. The second, a SSR associated with the symmetric group,\nis applicable to ensemble QI processing such as in liquid-NMR. We prove that\neven for an ensemble comprising many pairs of qubits, with each pair described\nby a pure Bell state, the entanglement per pair constrained by this SSR goes to\nzero for a large ensemble.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Sep 2003 04:41:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}
