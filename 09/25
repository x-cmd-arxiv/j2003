The\nintensity of the iron line (also consistent with a Chandra measurement) as well\nas the normalization of the reflection hump are consistent with a constant in\nthe two epochs: this, combined with the fact that the line is narrow as\nobserved by Chandra, suggests a common origin from distant and optically thick\nmatter.

A substantial\ncharge transfer is seen in nearly all clusters with the exception of Al2Li2\nwhere the charge transfer is not significant.

By working\nout an exact analytic solution, we show that the probability of success depends\ncrucially on the spectral function of the injected photon. With a cavity\nphoton, one can generate a maximally entangled state with a certain probability\nthat is always less than 50%. However, for an injected photon with a narrower\nspectral width, this probability can be significantly increased. In particular,\nwe discover situations in which entanglement can be achieved in a single trial\nwith an almost unit probability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Sep 2003 18:07:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

His physical ideas are based on\nthe general conceptual and methodological preconditions of physical theories.\nSuch a line of reasoning about the foundations of physics has brought\nWeizsaecker into an abstract program of a possible reconstruction of physics in\nterms of yes-no-alternatives, which he called \"ur-theory.\" I shall start this\npaper with a review of the basic ideas of ur-theory: the definition of an ur\nand the connection between ur-spinors and spacetime. I then go over to some of\nur-theory's present borders: the construction of quantized spacetime tetrads\nand the difficulties to incorporate gravity and gauge theories. Finally, I\nshall discuss the possible prospects of ur-theory -- partly with a view to\nmodern quantum gravity approaches, but mainly in connection with its\nphilosophical implications.
