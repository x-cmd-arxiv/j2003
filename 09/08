This result rules out the Eastern model\nfor LMXB which is extensively used, in which the Comptonizing region is a small\ncentral region. The ADC size depends strongly on the 1 - 30 keV source\nluminosity via a simple relationship r_ADC = L^{0.88 +/- 0.16} (99% confidence)\nclose to a simple proportionality. We also present limited evidence that the\nADC size agrees with the Compton radius r_C, or maximum radius for hydrostatic\nequilibrium. The results are consistent with models in which an extended ADC is\nformed by illumination of the disc by the central source. The dependence on\nluminosity may reflect the known decrease of coronal temperature as the source\nluminosity increases leading to an increase of r_C. The extended nature of the\nADC means that the seed photons for Comptonization must consist of emission\nfrom the disc to the same radial extent as the corona, providing copious\nsupplies of soft seed photons. We demonstrate the importance of the size of the\nADC to the correct description of Comptonization, and derive the Comptonized\nspectrum of a LMXB based on thermal Comptonization of these seed photons and\nshow that this differs fundamentally from that of the Eastern model which\nassumes a cut-off below 1 keV.

During the first 100 days the line\nprofiles are composed of three major components: (i) narrow P Cygni lines with\nabsorption minima at -700 km/s; (ii) broad emission lines with BVZI ~4000 km/s;\n(iii) broad wings most apparent in H-alpha. These components are identified\nwith the expanding circumstellar (CS) envelope (Sollerman, Cumming & Lundqvist\n1998), shocked cool gas in the forward postshock region, and multiple Thomson\nscattering in the CS envelope, respectively. The absence of broad P Cygni lines\nfrom the supernova (SN) is the result of the formation of an optically thick,\ncool, dense shell at the interface of the ejecta and the CS envelope. Models of\nthe SN deceleration and Thomson scattering wings are used to recover the\nThomson optical depth of the CS envelope and its radial extent, 4E15 cm. The\nlight curve, which we reproduce by a hydrodynamical model, is powered by a\ncombination of internal energy leakage after the explosion of an extended\npresupernova (~1E15 cm) and luminosity from circumstellar interaction. We\nrecover the pre-explosion kinematics of the CS envelope and find it to be close\nto homologous expansion with outmost velocity ~1100 km/s and a kinematic age of\n\\~1.5 yr. The high mass and kinetic energy of the CS envelope strongly suggest\nthat the CS envelope was explosively ejected only a few years before explosion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Sep 2003 09:57:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Magnetic concentrations such as fragments, pores and\nsunspots, are `nodes' joined by flux tubes or `links'. The number of links\nemanating from a node is scale-free.
