More\nspecifically, we explore the dependence of the positions and amplitudes of\nfeatures in the gas flow on the temperature of the interstellar medium (assumed\nto behave as a one-component isothermal fluid), the non-axisymmetric disk\ncontribution to the galactic potential, the pattern speed, Omega_p, and finally\nthe numerical resolution of the simulation. We argue that, after constraining\nthe pattern speed reasonably well by matching the simulations to the observed\nspiral arm morphology, the amplitude of the non-axisymmetric perturbation (the\ndisk fraction) is left as the primary parameter determining the gas dynamics.\nHowever, due to the sensitivity of the positions of the shocks to modeling\nparameters, one has to be cautious when quantitatively comparing the\nsimulations to observations. In particular, we show that a global least squares\nanalysis is not the optimal method for distinguishing different models as it\ntends to slightly favor low disk fraction models. Nevertheless, we conclude\nthat, given observational data of reasonably high spatial resolution and an\naccurate shock-resolving hydro-code this method tightly constrains the dark\nmatter content within spiral galaxies. We further argue that even if the\nperturbations induced by spiral arms are weaker than those of strong bars, they\nare better suited for this kind of analysis because the spiral arms extend to\nlarger radii where effects like inflows due to numerical viscosity and\nmorphological dependence on gas sound speed are less of a concern than they are\nin the centers of disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Sep 2003 19:40:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We propose that\nthe FRM distribution can be used to discuss the 3-dimensional structure of\nmagnetic field around jets, together with the projected magnetic field derived\nfrom the Stokes parameters. In the present paper, we supposed the basic\nstraight part of AGN jet, and used the data of axisymmetric simulation. The FRM\ndistribution we derived has a general tendency to have gradient across the jet\naxis, which is due to the toroidal component of the helical magnetic field\ngenerated by the rotation of the accretion disk. This kind of gradient in the\nFRM distribution is actually observed in some AGN jets (e.g. Asada et al.\n2002), which suggests helical magnetic field around the jets and thus supports\nour MHD model. Following this success, we are now extending our numerical\nobservation to the wiggled part of the jets using the data of 3-dimensional\nsimulation based on our model in the following paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Sep 2003 04:41:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

However, copying seems rather different in the quantum regime.\nSince the discovery of the universal quantum cloning machine, much has been\nfound from the fundamental point of view about quantum copying. But a basic\nquestion as to the utility of universal quantum cloning remains. We have\nconsidered its application in quantum state restoration by using cloning\ncircuit for state estimation. It might be expected that classical information\nfrom the state estimation might help restore the quantum state that was\ndisturbed during transmission. We find that the fidelity of the final state is,\ninterestingly, independent of error probabilities inside the channel. However,\nthis also turns out to impose a severe constraint on our original aims.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Sep 2003 14:42:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Nov 2003 19:03:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

A simplified theoretical model for\nthe dynamics of the system is developed upon the assumption of adiabaticity of\nthe atomic motion. We show that in a regime where the light shift per photon\ntimes the number of atoms exceeds the line width of the cavity resonance, the\notherwise tiny retro-action of the atoms upon the light field becomes a\nsignificant feature of the system, giving rise to dispersive optical\nbistability of the intra-cavity field. A solution of the complete set of\nclassical equations of motion confirms these finding, however additional\nnon-adiabatic phenomena are predicted, as for example self-induced radial\nbreathing oscillations. We compare these results with experiments involving\nlaser-cooled 85Rb atoms trapped in an optical lattice inside a ring cavity with\na finesse of 180000. Temperature measurements conducted for moderate values of\nthe atom-cavity interaction demonstrate that intensity-noise induced heating is\nkept at a very low level, a prerequisite for our further experiments. When we\noperate at large values of the atom--cavity interaction we observe bistability\nand breathing oscillations in excellent agreement with our theoretical\npredictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Sep 2003 15:09:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Sep 2003 10:10:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
