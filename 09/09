The high energy component carried at least $\\sim$ 3 times more\nenergy than the lower energy component.

We examine possible explanations for this high energy\nspectral component and find that most models fail. The only emission region\nthat provides the right temporal behavior is the reverse shock that goes into\nthe GRB ejecta as it is decelerated by the ambient medium, or possibly the very\nearly forward shock while the reverse shock is still going on.

The polymer and the solvent obey\ntwo-fluid dynamics in which the viscoelastic stress acts asymmetrically on the\npolymer and, as a result, the stress and the diffusion are dynamically coupled.\nBelow the coexistence curve, interfaces appear with increasing the quench depth\nand the solvent regions act as a lubricant. In these cases the composition\nheterogeneity causes more enhanced viscoelastic heterogeneity and the\nmacroscopic stress is decreased at fixed applied shear rate. We find steady\ntwo-phase states composed of the polymer-rich and solvent-rich regions, where\nthe characteristic domain size is inversely proportional to the average shear\nstress for various shear rates. The deviatoric stress components exhibit large\ntemporal fluctuations. The normal stress difference can take negative values\ntransiently at weak shear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Sep 2003 10:06:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Sep 2003 17:23:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 10 Oct 2004 19:32:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

In the coordinate frame in which these observers\nare at rest, the horizon manifests itself as a (coordinate) singularity in the\nmetric tensor.

We calculate the pressure to next-to-leading order in the 1/N\nexpansion and show that at this order, only the minimum of the effective\npotential can be rendered finite by temperature-independent renormalization. To\nobtain a finite effective potential away from the minimum requires an arbitrary\nchoice of prescription, which implies that the temperature dependence is\nambiguous. We show that the problem is linked to thermal infrared renormalons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Sep 2003 10:32:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Jan 2004 11:02:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The author\nintroduces a notion of family of Tate spaces (\"Tate\" means \"locally linearly\ncompact\") and claims that it is local. The definition takes in account that the\nK_{-1} of a ring is not necessarily zero. However, we prove that K_{-1} always\nvanishes after Nisnevich sheafification. As a discrete counterpart of families\nof Tate spaces, we introduce the notion of almost projective module. We discuss\nthe notions of dimension torsor and determinant gerbe of a family of Tate\nspaces.\n  The above technique has two different applications.\n  First, we clarify the structure of the ind-scheme of formal loops of a smooth\naffine manifold Y. This allows to define a \"refined\" motivic integral of a\ndifferential form on Y with no zeros, which is an object of a triangulated\ncategory rather than an element of its K_0 group.\n  Second, we show that almost projective modules and families of Tate spaces\nappear naturally in the study of the cohomology of a family of\nfinite-dimensional vector bundles on a punctured smooth manifold. The canonical\ncentral extension that comes from this cohomology allows to interpret the\n\"Uhlenbeck compactification\" of the stack of vector bundles on the projective\nplane as the fine moduli space of a certain type of generalized vector bundles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Sep 2003 21:38:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Sep 2003 14:54:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 22 Jan 2004 18:04:16 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2004 15:51:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Multimode operation in gas versus semiconductor lasers\narises from different physics. In gas lasers, slow equilibration of the\nelectron populations at different energies makes each frequency an independent\nsingle-mode laser. The slow electron diffusion in semiconductor lasers,\ncombined with the spatially varying optical intensity patterns of the modes,\nmakes each region of space an independent single-mode laser. We develop a rate\nequation model for the photon number in each mode which captures all these\neffects. Plotting the photon number versus pumping rate for the competing\nmodes, in both subthreshold and above threshold operation, illustrates the\nchanges in the laser output spectrum due to either slow equilibration or slow\ndiffusion of electrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Sep 2003 12:26:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In particular,\nwe discuss the possibility of creating coherent superposition states in a\nsystem with coupling pattern $J=0\\Leftrightarrow J=1$ and $J=1\\Leftrightarrow\nJ=2$. Initially, the system is in the J=0 state.
