Moreover, scalar field\nat the bounce exceeds the planckian value and on expansion stage these models\ncorrespond to chaotic inflation. Such solutions can be well approximated by\nexplicitly solvable model with constant effective potential (cosmological term)\nand massless scalar field during the bounce and on stages of quasi-exponential\ncontraction and expansion.

The astrophysical problem lies in the fact\nthat several major stages in binary evolution, such as common envelope\nevolution, are still poorly understood. The best we can do in these cases is to\nparametrize our ignorance, in a way that is reminiscent of the introduction of\na mixing length to describe convection in a single star, or an alpha parameter\nin modeling an accretion disk. The hope is that by modeling a whole star\ncluster in great detail, and comparing the results to the wealth of\nobservational data currently available, we will be able to constrain the\nparameters that capture the unknown physics. The computational problem is one\nof composition: while we have accurate computer codes for modeling stellar\ndynamics, stellar hydrodynamics, and stellar evolution, we currently have no\ngood way to put all this knowledge together in a single software environment.

The\nmethod relies on endowing the molecules with an appropriate positive charge,\nstorage in a linear radiofrequency trap, and sympathetic cooling. Two\nwell--known atomic coolant species, ${}^9{\\hbox{Be}}^+$ and\n${}^{137}{\\hbox{Ba}}^+$, are sufficient for cooling the molecular mass range\nfrom 2 to 20,000 amu. The large molecular charge required for simultaneous\ntrapping of heavy molecules and of the coolant ions can easily be produced\nusing electrospray ionization. Crystallized molecular ions offer vast\nopportunities for novel studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Sep 2003 14:59:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
