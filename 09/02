The\nmagnitude of the diffusivity is D \\approx \\dot\\gamma a^2 where a is the\nparticle radius. However, the gradient in shear rate, coupling to the mean\nflow, and drag at the moving boundary lead to particle displacements that can\nappear sub- or super-diffusive. In particular, diffusion appears superdiffusive\nalong the mean flow direction due to Taylor dispersion effects and subdiffusive\nalong the perpendicular direction due to the gradient in shear rate. The\nanisotropic force network leads to an additional anisotropy in the diffusivity\nthat is a property of dense systems with no obvious analog in rapid flows.\nSpecifically, the diffusivity is supressed along the direction of the strong\nforce network. A simple random walk simulation reproduces the key features of\nthe data, such as the apparent superdiffusive and subdiffusive behavior arising\nfrom the mean flow, confirming the underlying diffusive motion.
