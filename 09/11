The\ndetailed knowledge of this motion is important conceptually and practically,\nbecause the mirrors of laser interferometric detectors of gravitational waves\nare essentially free test masses. There exists an analogy between the motion of\nfree masses in the field of a gravitational wave and the motion of free charges\nin the field of an electromagnetic wave. In particular, a gravitational wave\ndrives the masses in the plane of the wave-front and also, to a smaller extent,\nback and forth in the direction of the wave's propagation. To describe this\nmotion, we introduce the notion of `electric' and `magnetic' components of the\ngravitational force. This analogy is not perfect, but it reflects some\nimportant features of the phenomenon. Using different methods, we demonstrate\nthe presence and importance of what we call the `magnetic' component of motion\nof free masses. It contributes to the variation of distance between a pair of\nparticles. We explicitely derive the full response function of a 2-arm laser\ninterferometer to a gravitational wave of arbitrary polarization. We give a\nconvenient description of the response function in terms of the spin-weighted\nspherical harmonics. We show that the previously ignored `magnetic' component\nmay provide a correction of up to 10 %, or so, to the usual `electric'\ncomponent of the response function.

The net force acting on the partition wall is nonzero at zero temperature\nand remains almost constant for low temperatures. As the temperature increases,\nthe force starts to decrease considerably, but after reaching a minimum it\nstarts to increase, and tends to infinity with a square-root-of-temperature\nasympotics. This example demonstrates clearly that distinct boundary conditions\ncause remarkable physical effects for quantum systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Sep 2003 09:05:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
