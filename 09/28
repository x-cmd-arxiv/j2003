In this paper I show that an algorithmic procedure\nthat makes it finite exists, under certain conditions. To achieve this result,\ngravity is coupled with an interacting conformal field theory C. The Newton\nconstant and the marginal parameters of C are taken as independent couplings.\nThe values of the other irrelevant couplings are determined iteratively in the\nloop- and energy-expansions, imposing that their beta functions vanish. The\nfiniteness equations are solvable thanks to the following properties: the beta\nfunctions of the irrelevant couplings have a simple structure; the irrelevant\nterms made with the Riemann tensor can be reabsorbed by means of field\nredefinitions; the other irrelevant terms have, generically, non-vanishing\nanomalous dimensions. The perturbative expansion is governed by an effective\nPlanck mass that takes care of the interactions in the matter sector. As an\nexample, I study gravity coupled with Chern-Simons U(1) gauge theory with\nmassless fermions, solve the finiteness equations and determine the\nfour-fermion couplings to two-loop order.

Since the parent\nand daughter theories are planar equivalent, at N\\to\\infty the effective\nLagrangians in the orientifold theories basically coincide with the bosonic\npart of the VY Lagrangian.\n  We depart from the supersymmetric limit in two ways. First, we consider\nfinite (albeit large) values of N. Then 1/N effects break supersymmetry.
