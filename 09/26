A second\nimportant observation is that globular cluster systems typically have bimodal\ncolor distributions.

This involves \"coding\" the multiple zeta values by\nmonomials in two noncommuting variables x and y. Multiple zeta values can then\nbe thought of as defining a map \\zeta: H^0 -> R, where H^0 is the graded\nrational vector space generated by the \"admissible words\" of the noncommutative\npolynomial algebra Q<x,y>. Now H^0 admits two (commutative) products making\n\\zeta a homomorphism: the shuffle product and the \"harmonic\" product. The\nlatter makes H^0 a subalgebra of the algebra QSym of quasi-symmetric functions.\nWe also discuss some results about multiple zeta values that can be stated in\nterms of derivations and cyclic derivations of Q<x,y>, and define an action of\nthe Hopf algebra QSym on Q<x,y> that appears useful. Finally, we apply the\nalgebraic approach to finite partial sums of multiple zeta value series.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Sep 2003 22:08:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Aug 2004 16:27:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-10-31"}

This mechanism points at a possible general principle\nof how computation in gene regulation networks can be kept in a\nquasi-deterministic ``clockwork mode'' in spite of the absence of a central\nclock. A delay similar to the one occurring in gene regulation causes\nsynchronization in the model. Stability under asynchronous dynamics disfavors\ntopologies containing loops, comparing well with the observed strong\nsuppression of loops in biological regulatory networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Sep 2003 20:03:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The notion of\nself-consistent evolution for quantum computers whose components follow closed\ntimelike curves, as pointed out by Deutsch [Phys. Rev.
