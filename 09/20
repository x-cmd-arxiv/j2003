A\nsimilarly high incidence (>~50%) of narrow CIV absorbers is detected for the\nradio-quiet and radio-loud quasars, and a constant ~25% of all the quasars,\nirrespective of radio type display associated CIV absorbers stronger than a\nrest equivalent width of 0.5A. Both radio-quiet and radio-loud quasars with\nnarrow absorption lines have systematically redder continua, especially\nstrongly absorbed objects. There is evidence of inclination dependent dust\nreddening and absorption for the radio quasars. An additional key result is\nthat the most strongly absorbed radio quasars have the largest radio source\nextent. This result is in stark contrast to a recent study of the low-frequency\nselected Molonglo survey in which a connection between the strength of the\nnarrow absorbers and the (young) age of the radio source has been proposed. The\npossible origin of these discrepant results is discussed and may be related to\nthe higher source luminosity for the quasars studied here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Sep 2003 02:30:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

For all wall velocities\nexplored, the stress in the final state of the system after wall movement is\nfundamentally different from the original state obtained by pouring particles\ninto the container and letting them settle under the influence of gravity. The\noriginal packing possesses a hydrostatic-like region at the top of the\ncontainer which crosses over to a depth-independent stress.

Semantic orientation varies in both direction (positive or\nnegative) and degree (mild to strong). An automated system for measuring\nsemantic orientation would have application in text classification, text\nfiltering, tracking opinions in online discussions, analysis of survey\nresponses, and automated chat systems (chatbots). This paper introduces a\nmethod for inferring the semantic orientation of a word from its statistical\nassociation with a set of positive and negative paradigm words. Two instances\nof this approach are evaluated, based on two different statistical measures of\nword association: pointwise mutual information (PMI) and latent semantic\nanalysis (LSA). The method is experimentally tested with 3,596 words (including\nadjectives, adverbs, nouns, and verbs) that have been manually labeled positive\n(1,614 words) and negative (1,982 words). The method attains an accuracy of\n82.8% on the full test set, but the accuracy rises above 95% when the algorithm\nis allowed to abstain from classifying mild words.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Sep 2003 16:30:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Large changes of amplitudes and velocities of the colliding solitons\nare generated by weak perturbations, showing that the elasticity of soliton\ncollisions in the AL model is fragile (for instance, the Salerno's perturbation\nwith the relative strength of 0.08 can give rise to a change of the solitons'\namplitudes by a factor exceeding 2).
