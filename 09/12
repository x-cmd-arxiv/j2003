The\nvariation of the cross-correlation with z_s depends purely on ratios of angular\ndiameter distances.

The signal is,\nhowever, very small, amounting to a change of a few parts in 10^3 of the\nlensing distortion. The calibration of lensing distortion must be independent\nof redshift to comparable levels, and photometric redshifts must be similarly\nfree of bias.

The contribution of the old population to the K-band luminosity\ndepends on the birthrate parameter and remains above 60% in the majority of the\nsample galaxies. Even in the blue band, the intermediate age and old\npopulations contribute more than 40% of the total flux in all the cases.

The\nextinction of the old population is found to be around half of that of the\nyoung population. The contribution to the continuum from the relatively old\nstars has the effect of diluting the emission equivalent widths below the\nvalues expected for young bursts.

Furthermore, hard X-rays are less\naffected than other bands by obscuration. For these reasons the advent of\nimaging instruments above 2 keV, has permitted to dramatically improve our\nunderstanding of accretion-powered sources and their cosmic evolution. By\nminimizing the problems of AGN selection and nuclear obscuration, the\ncombination of deep and shallow hard X-ray surveys, performed first with ASCA\nand BeppoSAX and then with Chandra and XMM (e.g. ASCA LSS, HELLAS, CDFN, CDFS,\nLockman Hole, SSA13, HELLAS2XMM etc.), allows a detailed study of the evolution\nof accreting sources. Somewhat surprising results are emerging: 1) the sources\nmaking the Cosmic X-ray Background peak at a redshift (z=0.7-1) lower than soft\nX-ray selected sources and lower than predicted by synthesis models for the\nCXB; 2) there is strong evidence of a luminosity dependence of the evolution,\nlow luminosity sources (i.e. Seyfert galaxies) peaking at a significantly later\ncosmic time than high luminosity sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Sep 2003 14:59:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The data are consistent with the\nformation of very massive stars (> 50-100 Msun) and require a flattening of the\nstarburst IMF below a few solar masses assuming a Salpeter slope at higher\nmasses. Our results are well matched by a scenario in which the global\nstarburst activity in M82 occurred in two successive episodes each lasting a\nfew million years, peaking about 10 and 5 Myr ago. The first episode took place\nthroughout the central regions of M82 and was particularly intense at the\nnucleus while the second episode occurred predominantly in a circumnuclear ring\nand along the stellar bar. We interpret this sequence as resulting from the\ngravitational interaction M82 and its neighbour M81, and subsequent bar-driven\nevolution.

However,\nwe show that in order to maintain vacuum stability, such a model requires that\nthe heavy Higgs boson states have masses that lie close to approximately mu tan\nbeta. Therefore, a measurement of the Heavy Higgs boson masses at the LHC would\nallow one to either rule out the NMSSM PQ axion, or provide tantalizing\ncircumstantial evidence for its existence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Sep 2003 13:35:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Due to its anisotropic electrostatic interaction, its\nscattering length is determined by five interaction potentials instead of one,\neven in the spin-polarized case, a unique property among the Bose condensed\nspecies and candidates. Because the interaction potentials of Ne* are not known\naccurately enough to predict the value of the scattering length, we investigate\nthe behavior of $a$ as a function of the five phase integrals corresponding to\nthe five interaction potentials. We find that the scattering length has five\nresonances instead of only one and cannot be described by a simple gas-kinetic\napproach or the DIS approximation. However, the probability for finding a\npositive or large value of the scattering length is not enhanced compared to\nthe single potential case. The complex behavior of $a$ is studied by comparing\na quantum mechanical five-channel numerical calculation to simpler two-channel\nmodels.
