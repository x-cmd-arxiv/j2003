We build a radiative transfer model of a carbon star surrounded\nby an expanding detached shell of dust. The shell contains amorphous carbon\ngrains and MgS grains. We find that a small fraction of MgS dust (2% of the\ndust mass) can give a significant contribution to the IRAS 25 micron flux.\nHowever, the presence of MgS in the detached shell cannot be inferred from the\nIRAS broadband photometry alone but requires infrared spectroscopy. We apply\nthe model to the detached-shell sources R Scl and U Cam, both exhibiting a cool\nMgS feature in their ISO/SWS spectra. We use the shell parameters derived for\nthe molecular shell, using the CO submillimetre maps. The models, with MgS\ngrains located in the detached shell, explain the MgS grain temperature, as\nderived from their ISO spectra, very well. This demonstrates that the MgS\ngrains are located at the distance of the detached shell, which is a direct\nindication that these shells originate from a time when the stellar photosphere\nwas already carbon-rich. In the case of R Scl, the IRAS photometry is\nsimultaneously explained by the single shell model. In the case of U Cam, the\nIRAS photometry is under predicted, pointing to a contribution from cooler dust\nlocated even further away from the star than the molecular shell.

The MEDs of fragments\nfor heated fission were shown to consist of two components. One component,\nwhich is due to classical fusion-fission, is associated with the symmetric\nfission of the 256No compound nucleus. The other component, which appears as\n''shoulders'', is associated with the quasi-fission process and can be named\n''quasi-fission shoulders''. Those quasi-fission shoulders enclose light\nfragments whose masses are 60-90 a.m.u. The total kinetic energy (TKE) of the\nfragments that belong to the shoulders is higher than the value expected for a\nclassical fusion-fission process. We have come to the conclusion that in\nquasi-fission, spherical shells with Z=28 and N=50 play a great role. It has\nalso been demonstrated that the properties of the MEDs of fragments formally\nagree with a well-known hypothesis of two independent fission modes; in this\ncase the modes are normal fusion-fission and quasi-fission processes. A\nhigh-energetic Super-Short mode of classical fission has been found at low\nexcitation energies in the mass range of heavy fragments M = 130-135 and TKE =\n233 MeV; however the yield associated with this mode is small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Sep 2003 13:02:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}
