M. Keck II 10-meter telescope's adaptive optics system, that is\ncoincident to within 18 mas of the Galaxy's central supermassive black hole and\nthe unique radio source Sgr A*. While in 2002 this source (SgrA*-IR) was\nconfused with the stellar source S0-2, in 2003 these two sources are separated\nby 87 mas allowing the new source's properties to be determined directly. On\nfour separate nights, its observed L' magnitude ranges from 12.2 to 13.8, which\ncorresponds to a flux density of 0.7 - 3 mJy, observed, and 4 - 17 mJy,\ndereddened; no other source in this region shows such large variations in flux\ndensity - a factor of 4 over a week and a factor of 2 over 40 min. In addition,\nit has a K-L' color greater than 2.1, which is at least 1 mag redder than any\nother source detected at L' in its vicinity. Based on this source's coincidence\nwith the Galaxy's dynamical center, its lack of motion, its variability, and\nits red color, we conclude that it is associated with the central supermassive\nblack hole. The short timescale for the 3.8 micron flux density variations\nimplies that the emission arises in the accretion flow on physical size scales\nsmaller than 5 AU, or 80 R_s for a 4x10^6 Mo black hole. We suggest that the\n3.8 micron emission and the X-ray flares arise from the same underlying\nphysical process, possibly the acceleration of a small populations of electrons\nto ultrarelativistic energies. In contrast to the X-ray flares which are only\ndetectable 2% of the time, the 3.8 micron emission provides a new, constantly\naccessible, window into the physical conditions of the plasma in close\nproximity to the central black hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Sep 2003 21:52:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Jan 2004 16:42:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

This analysis leads us to the\nfollowing results. 1) NGC 3783 fluctuated in luminosity by a factor ~1.5 during\nindividual observations (~170 ks duration). These fluctuations were not\nassociated with significant spectral variations. 2) On a longer time scale\n(20-120 days), we found the source to exhibit two very different spectral\nshapes. The main difference between these can be well-described by the\nappearance and disappearance of a spectral component that dominates the\nunderlying continuum at the longest wavelengths. The spectral variations are\nnot related to the brightening or the fading of the continuum at short\nwavelengths in any simple way. 3) The appearance of the soft continuum\ncomponent is consistent with being the only spectral variation, and there is no\nneed to invoke changes in the opacity of the absorbers. 4) Photoionization\nmodeling indicates that a combination of three ionized absorbers, each split\ninto two kinematic components, can explain the strengths of almost all the\nabsorption lines and bound-free edges. All three components are thermally\nstable and seem to have the same gas pressure. 5) The only real discrepancy\nbetween our model and the observations concerns the range of wavelengths\nabsorbed by the iron M-shell UTA feature. This most likely arises as the result\nof our underestimation of the poorly-known dielectronic recombination rates\nappropriate for these ions. 6) The lower limit on the distance of the absorbing\ngas in NGC 3783 is between 0.2 and 3.2 pc. The assumption of pressure\nequilibrium imposes an upper limit of about 25 pc on the distance of the\nleast-ionized component from the central source.

These expansions\nshow that generic time symmetric initial data with an analytic conformal metric\nat spatial infinity will give rise to developments with a certain type of\nlogarithmic singularities at the points where null infinity and spatial\ninfinity meet. These logarithmic singularities produce a non-smooth null\ninfinity. The sources of the logarithmic singularities are traced back down to\nthe initial data. It is shown that is the parts of the initial data responsible\nfor the non-regular behaviour of the solutions are not present, then the\ninitial data is static to a certain order. On the basis of these results it is\nconjectured that the only time symmetric data sets with developments having a\nsmooth null infinity are those which are static in a neighbourhood of infinity.\nThis conjecture generalises a previous conjecture regarding time symmetric,\nconformally flat data. The relation of these conjectures to Penrose's proposal\nfor the description of the asymptotic gravitational field of isolated bodies is\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Sep 2003 07:26:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2004 14:42:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}

Recently Dreyer has argued that this\nparameter may be fixed by considering the quasinormal mode spectrum of black\nholes, while at the price of changing the gauge group to SO(3) rather than the\noriginal one SU(2). Physically such a replacement is not quite natural or\ndesirable. In this paper we study the relationship between the black hole\nentropy and the quasi normal mode spectrum in the loop quantization of N=1\nsupergravity. We find that a single value of the Immirzi parameter agrees with\nthe semiclassical expectations as well. But in this case the lowest\nsupersymmetric representation dominates, fitting well with the result based on\nstatistical consideration. This suggests that, so long as fermions are included\nin the theory, supersymemtry may be favored for the consistency of the low\nenergy limit of loop quantum gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Sep 2003 09:18:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Starting with integral relations with one subtraction and\nconsidering parametrizations for the total cross sections belonging to the\nclass of entire functions in the logarithm of the energy, a series of results\nis deduced and our main conclusions are the following: (1) except for the\nsubtraction constant, the derivative forms do not depend on any additional free\nparameter; (2) the only approximation in going from integral to derivative\nrelations (at high energies) concerns to assume as zero the lower limit in the\nintegral form; (3) the previous approximation and the subtraction constant\naffect the fit results at both low and high energies and therefore, the\nsubtraction constant can not be disregarded; (4) from a practical point of\nview, for single-pole Pomeron and secondary reggeons parametrizations and\ncenter-of-mass energies above 5 GeV, the derivative relations with the\nsubtraction constant as a free fit parameter are completely equivalent to the\nintegral forms with finite (non-zero) lower limit. A detailed review on the\nconditions of validity and assumptions related with the replacement of integral\nby derivative relations is also presented and discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Sep 2003 19:46:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Dec 2003 14:20:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2004 22:11:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
