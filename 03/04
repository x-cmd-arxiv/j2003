To explain the morphology and kinematics of the Owl\nNebula, we suggest the following scenario for its formation and evolution. The\nearly mass loss at the TP-AGB phase forms the halo, and the superwind at the\nend of the AGB phase forms the main nebula. The subsequent fast stellar wind\ncompressed the superwind to form the inner shell and excavated an elongated\ncavity at the center, but has ceased in the past. At the current old age, the\ninner shell is backfilling the central cavity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Mar 2003 22:26:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

A similar, but\ndistinct, and also long standing question is whether the structural appearances\nof galaxies, as seen through their stellar light distributions, contain enough\nphysical information to offer this classification. We argue through the use of\n240 images of nearby galaxies that three model independent parameters measured\non a single galaxy image reveal its major ongoing and past formation modes, and\ncan be used as a robust classification system. These parameters quantitatively\nmeasure: the concentration (C), asymmetry (A) and clumpiness (S) of a galaxy's\nstellar light distribution. When combined into a three dimensional `CAS' volume\nall major classes of galaxies in various phases of evolution are cleanly\ndistinguished. We argue that these three parameters correlate with important\nmodes of galaxy evolution: star formation and major merging activity. This is\nargued through the strong correlation of Halpha equivalent width and broad band\ncolors with the clumpiness parameter, the uniquely large asymmetries of 66\ngalaxies undergoing mergers, and the correlation of bulge to total light\nratios, and stellar masses, with the concentration index. As an obvious goal is\nto use this system at high redshifts to trace evolution, we demonstrate that\nthese parameters can be measured, within a reasonable and quantifiable\nuncertainty, with available data out to z ~ 3 using the Hubble Space Telescope\nGOODS ACS and Hubble Deep Field images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Mar 2003 08:48:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Through this\ncoupling, the potential determining the evolution of the inflaton field is made\ntime-dependent. Due to this the frequency of parametric resonance becomes time\ndependent, making the reheating process especially effective. All fields\nincluding the gravitational field are initially simplified by expanding each in\nterms of the respective homogeneity or inhomogeneity. Employing only the lowest\norder of this expansion, we space-average, and introduce all independent\naverages as new variables. This leads to a hierarchy of equations for the\nspatial moments of the fields and their derivatives. A small expansion\nparameter permits a truncation to lowest order, yielding a closed system of 5\ncoupled nonlinear first order differential equations. For a parabolic\npotential, the energy densities of the matter and inflaton fields oscillate\nchaotically around each other from the end of inflation until they reach\nextremely small values.

Both the\nstandard method of correlating particles with an event plane, and the cumulant\nmethod of studying multiparticle correlations are used. In the standard method\nthe directed flow is corrected for conservation of momentum. In the cumulant\nmethod elliptic flow is reconstructed from genuine 4, 6, and 8-particle\ncorrelations, showing the first unequivocal evidence for collective motion in\nA+A collisions at SPS energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Mar 2003 12:49:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Jul 2003 21:43:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

A\nstronger enhancement in the forward rapidity region of the projectile is also\npredicted, resulting in a unique rapidity asymmetry of the hadron spectra at\nhigh $p_T$. The shape of the rapidity asymmetry should be reversed for low\n$p_T$ hadrons that are dominated by soft and coherent interactions which\nsuppress hadron spectra in the projectile rapidity region. The phenomenon at\nthe LHC energies is shown to be qualitatively different because of parton\nshadowing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Mar 2003 20:59:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
