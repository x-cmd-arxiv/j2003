The multipole spectral index decreases with Galactic\nlatitude (i.e. the spectrum becomes flatter), but is consistent with a constant\nvalue over Galactic longitude. Power spectra of the rotation measure RM show a\nspectral index of about 1, while the structure function of RM is approximately\nflat. The structure function is flatter than earlier estimates from polarized\nextragalactic sources, which could be due to the fact that extragalactic source\nRM probes the complete line of sight through the Galaxy, whereas as a result of\ndepolarization diffuse radio polarization only probes the nearby ISM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Mar 2003 00:15:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-23"}

In doing so, it clarifies some of the claims made in earlier\npapers on PT-symmetric quantum mechanics. In particular, it is shown here that\nthere are two ways to extend real symmetric Hamiltonians into the complex\ndomain: (i) The usual approach is to generalize such Hamiltonians to include\ncomplex Hermitian Hamiltonians. (ii) Alternatively, one can generalize real\nsymmetric Hamiltonians to include complex PT-symmetric Hamiltonians. In the\nfirst approach the spectrum remains real, while in the second approach the\nspectrum remains real if the PT symmetry is not broken. Both generalizations\ngive a consistent theory of quantum mechanics, but if D>2, a D-dimensional\nHermitian matrix Hamiltonian has more arbitrary parameters than a D-dimensional\nPT-symmetric matrix Hamiltonian.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Mar 2003 00:59:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

We also analyze our proposed device for inelastic-scattering and\nspin-orbit scattering. Strong spin-orbit scattering and more so inelastic\nscattering have a somewhat detrimental effect on spin/charge ratio especially\nin the strong pumping regime.
