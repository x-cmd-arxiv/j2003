To study the IR to millimeter properties of the diffuse sky at high\ngalactic latitude, we concentrate on the emission correlated with the HI gas.\nWe compute the emission spectrum of the dust/free-free/synchrotron components\nassociated with HI gas from low to large column densities. A significant\nresidual WMAP emission over the free-free, synchrotron and the dust\ncontribution is found from 3.2 to 9.1 mm. We show that this residual WMAP\nemission (normalised to 10$^{20}$ atoms/cm$^2$) (1) exhibits a constant\nspectrum from 3.2 to 9.1 mm and (2) significantly decreases in amplitude when\nN$_{HI}$ increases, contrary to the HI-normalised far-infrared emission which\nstays rather constant. It is thus very likely that the residual WMAP emission\nis not associated with the Large Grain dust component. The decrease in\namplitude with increasing opacity ressembles in fact to the decrease of the\ntransiently heated dust grain emission observed in dense interstellar clouds.\nThis is supported by an observed decrease of the HI-normalised 60 microns\nemission with HI column densities. Although this result should be interpreted\nwith care due to zodiacal residual contamination at 60 microns, it suggests\nthat the WMAP excess emission is associated with the small transiently heated\ndust particles. On the possible models of this so-called ``anomalous microwave\nemission'' linked to the small dust particles are the spinning dust and the\nexcess millimeter emission of the small grains, due to the cold temperatures\nthey can reach between two successive impacts with photons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Mar 2003 17:00:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 May 2003 10:47:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

This result\nderives from a comparison of several cluster samples to predictions in the\nframework of the currently favored $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology, and one possible\nexplanation for the discrepancy is that this cosmological model is not correct.\nIn this paper we discuss the incidence of giant arcs in the Red-Sequence\nCluster Survey (RCS), which again shows significant disagreement with\ntheoretical predictions. We briefly describe a total of eight strong lens\nsystems, seven of which are discussed here for the first time. Based on the\ndetails of these systems, in particular on the ratio of single to multiple arc\nsystems, we argue that it may be possible to explain this discrepancy in the\ncurrently favored cosmology, by modifying the details of the lenses themselves.\nSpecifically, the high incidence of multiple arc systems and their overall high\nredshift suggests that a sub-population of the global cluster population is\nresponsible for much of the observed lensing. The lack of lensing clusters at\n$z<0.64$ in the RCS indicates that a property associated with clusters at early\ntimes results in the boosted lensing cross sections; likely a combination of\nellipticity and elongation along the line of sight, substructure, and changes\nin the cluster mass profiles is responsible.

As a consequence, when there is\ndegeneracy, the ground state of the system becomes a many body state - unable\nto be described by a mean-field theory - and a gap is opened.

Using this ansatz, in addition to the\navoided crossing formation, two other effects of the electron-electron\ninteraction are pointed out: (i) the long-range part of the Coulomb potential\ntends to shift the position in magnetic field of the (avoided) crossing points\nand, (ii) at the points of (near) degeneracy, the interaction can drive the\nsystem from a singlet to a triplet state inducing new real crossing points in\nthe ground state energy curve as function of the field.

Accordingly, all non-local\nfeatures of a product Hamiltonian -- including the rate at which it can be used\nto produce entanglement, transmit classical or quantum information, or simulate\nother Hamiltonians -- depend only upon a single parameter. We identify this\nparameter and use it to obtain an explicit expression for the entanglement\ncapacity of all product Hamiltonians.
