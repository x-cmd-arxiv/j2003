We analyze here in detail two of them. The strongest one took\nplace in the soft state, with the 3-30 keV energy flux increasing 30 times with\nrespect to the preceding 16-s average. The e-folding time is ~ 7 ms for the\nmain flare and ~ 1 ms for its precursor. The spectrum strongly hardens during\nthe flare. On the other hand, flares in the hard state have generally lower\namplitudes and longer e-folding times, and their spectra soften during the\nflare, with the hardness of the spectrum at the flare peak similar for both\ntypes of the flares. The presence of the flares shows unusually dramatic events\ntaking place in the accretion flow of Cyg X-1. On the other hand, the rate of\noccurence of hard-state flares shows they may represent a high-flux end of the\ndistribution of shots present in usual lightcurves of Cyg X-1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Mar 2003 09:51:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2003 11:29:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

In ion channels and\nwater-conducting pores (aquaporins), one dimensional confinement in conjunction\nwith strong surface effects changes the physical behavior of water. In\nmolecular dynamics simulations of water in short (0.8 nm) hydrophobic pores the\nwater density in the pore fluctuates on a nanosecond time scale. In long\nsimulations (460 ns in total) at pore radii ranging from 0.35 nm to 1.0 nm we\nquantify the kinetics of oscillations between a liquid-filled and a\nvapor-filled pore. This behavior can be explained as capillary evaporation\nalternating with capillary condensation, driven by pressure fluctuations in the\nwater outside the pore. The free energy difference between the two states\ndepends linearly on the radius. The free energy landscape shows how a\nmetastable liquid state gradually develops with increasing radius. For radii\nlarger than ca. 0.55 nm it becomes the globally stable state and the vapor\nstate vanishes. One dimensional confinement affects the dynamic behavior of the\nwater molecules and increases the self diffusion by a factor of two to three\ncompared to bulk water. Permeabilities for the narrow pores are of the same\norder of magnitude as for biological water pores. Water flow is not continuous\nbut occurs in bursts. Our results suggest that simulations aimed at collective\nphenomena such as hydrophobic effects may require simulation times longer than\n50 ns.
