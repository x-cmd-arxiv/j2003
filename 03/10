The relation between the\nquantum framework and thermodynamical observables is examined. A four stroke\nheat engine model with a coupled two-level-system as a working fluid is used to\nexplore the fundamental relations. In the model used, the internal Hamiltonian\ndoes not commute with the external control field which defines the two\nadiabatic branches. Heat is transferred to the working fluid by coupling to hot\nand cold reservoirs under constant field values. Explicit quantum equation of\nmotion for the relevant observables are derived on all branches. The dynamics\non the heat transfer constant field branches is solved in closed form. On the\nadiabats, a general numerical solution is used and compared with a particular\nanalytic solution. These solutions are combined to construct the cycle of\noperation. The engine is then analyzed in terms of frequency-entropy and\nentropy-temperature graphs. The irreversible nature of the engine is the result\nof finite heat transfer rates and friction-like behavior due to\nnoncommutability of the internal and external Hamiltonian.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Mar 2003 12:40:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
