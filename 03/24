With this purpose the evolution equations are developed\nincluding quadratic terms in the derivatives of the metric perturbations and\nusing coordinate conditions that, in the linear case, reduce to the\nlongitudinal gauge. We obtain the general solution, in the coordinate space, of\nthe evolution equation for the scalar mode, and, in the case of spherical\nsymmetry, we express this solution in terms of unidimensional integrals of the\ninitial conditions: the initial values of the Newtonian potential and its first\ntime derivative.

Annual\nlayered (varved) deposits of a landslide dammed lake in the Santa Maria Basin\n(26 deg S, 66 deg W) with an age of 30,000 14C years provide an archive of\nprecipitation variability during this time. The comparison of these data with\npresent-day rainfall observations tests the hypothesis that increased rainfall\nvariability played a major role in landslide generation. A potential cause of\nsuch variability is the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The causal link\nbetween ENSO and local rainfall is quantified by using a new method of\nnonlinear data analysis, the quantitative analysis of cross recurrence plots\n(CRP). This method seeks similarities in the dynamics of two different\nprocesses, such as an ocean-atmosphere oscillation and local rainfall. Our\nanalysis reveals significant similarities in the statistics of both modern and\npalaeo-precipitation data. The similarities in the data suggest that an\nENSO-like influence on local rainfall was present at around 30,000 14C years\nago. Increased rainfall, which was inferred from a lake balance modeling in a\nprevious study, together with ENSO-like cyclicities could help to explain the\nclustering of landslides at around 30,000 14C years ago.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Mar 2003 14:04:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
