This confirms\nquantitatively earlier speculations that early-type galaxies are calcium\nunderabundant. We find a clear correlation between alpha/Ca ratio and central\nvelocity dispersion, which implies that more massive galaxies are more calcium\nunderabundant. Interestingly this correlation extends down to the dwarf\nspheroidal galaxies of the Local Group for which alpha/Ca ratios have been\nmeasured from high-resolution spectroscopy of individual stars (Shetrone et\nal.). The increase of the calcium underabundance with galaxy mass balances the\nhigher total metallicities of more massive galaxies, so that calcium abundance\nin early-type galaxies is fairly constant and in particular does not increase\nwith increasing galaxy mass. This result may be the key to understand why the\nCaII triplet absorption of early-type galaxies at 8600 A is constant to within\n5 per cent over a large range of velocity dispersions (Saglia et al.; Cenarro\net al.).

This code implements the\ncascade-evaporation-fission model of intermediate-energy photonuclear\nreactions. It includes multiparticle production in photoreactions on\nintranuclear nucleons, pre-equilibrium emission, and the statistical decay of\nexcited residual nuclei via competition of evaporation, fission, and\nmultifragmentation processes. The calculations show that in the GeV energy\nregion the fission process is not solely responsible for the entire total\nphotoabsorption cross section, even for the actinides: ~55-70% for 232-Th,\n\\~70-80% for 238-U, and ~80-95% for 233-U, 235-U, and 237-Np.

The method is based on the detection of the Coherent\nSynchrotron Radiation (CSR) spectrum produced by a bunch passing a dipole\nmagnet system. This work also contains a systematic treatment of synchrotron\nradiation theory which lies at the basis of CSR. Standard theory of synchrotron\nradiation uses several approximations whose applicability limits are often\nforgotten: here we present a systematic discussion about these assumptions.\nProperties of coherent synchrotron radiation from an electron moving along an\narc of a circle are then derived and discussed. We describe also an effective\nand practical diagnostic technique based on the utilization of an\nelectromagnetic undulator to record the energy of the coherent radiation pulse\ninto the central cone. This measurement must be repeated many times with\ndifferent undulator resonant frequencies in order to reconstruct the modulus of\nthe bunch form-factor. The retrieval of the bunch profile function from these\ndata is performed by means of deconvolution techniques: for the present work we\ntake advantage of a constrained deconvolution method. We illustrate with\nnumerical examples the potential of the proposed method for electron beam\ndiagnostics at the TESLA Test Facility (TTF) accelerator. Here we choose, for\nemphasis, experiments aimed at the measure of the strongly non-Gaussian\nelectron bunch profile in the TTF femtosecond-mode operation.
