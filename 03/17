Spectroscopic data are obtained for H II\nregions in 11 Virgo dIs distributed in the central and outer regions of the\ncluster. To ensure that oxygen abundances are derived in a homogeneous manner,\noxygen abundances for field and Virgo dIs are computed using the bright-line\nmethod and compared with abundances directly obtained from [O III]4363, where\navailable. They are found to agree to within about 0.2 dex with no systematic\noffset. At a given optical luminosity, there is no systematic difference in\noxygen abundance between the sample of Virgo dIs and the sample of nearby dIs.\nHowever, five of the eleven Virgo dIs exhibit much lower baryonic gas fractions\nthan field dIs at comparable oxygen abundances. Using field dIs as a reference,\na gas-deficiency index for dIs is constructed, making it possible\nquantitatively to identify which galaxies have lost gas. For the Virgo sample,\nsome of the dwarfs are gas-deficient by a factor of 30. The gas-deficiency\ncorrelates roughly with the X-ray surface brightness of the intracluster gas.\nRam-pressure stripping can best explain the observed gas-poor dIs in the\ncluster sample. Together with the lack of significant fading and reddening of\nthe gas-poor dIs compared to gas-normal dIs, these observations suggest that\nthe gas-poor dIs in Virgo have recently encountered the intracluster medium for\nthe first time. Faded remnants of gas-poor dIs in Virgo will resemble bright\ndwarf ellipticals presently seen in the cluster core.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Mar 2003 10:01:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The existence of a 70-MeV quantum was postulated by Mac Gregor and was\nshown to fit the Nambu empirical mass formula mn = (n/2)137me, n a positive\ninteger.

It is shown in this paper that recent data of new light mesons fit\ninto the CQ model (a pure electric model) without the introduction of magnetic\ncharges. However, by introducing electric and magnetic quarks (dyons) into the\nCQ model, new dynamical forces can be generated by the presence of magnetic\nfields internal to the quarks (dyons). The laws of angular momentum and of\nenergy conservation are valid in the presence of magnetic charge.

We prove some results about the boundary behaviour of a solution of\nthis problem. We describe the behaviour of a non-converging sequence of\nsolutions in term of lines of divergence in the domain. Using this second\nresult, we build some solutions of the Dirichlet problem on unbounded domain.\nWe then give a new proof of the result of C. Cos\\'\\i n and A. Ros concerning\nthe Plateau problem at infinity for horizontal ends.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Mar 2003 13:48:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Our calculations demonstrate that there are two criteria for\nentanglement, one associated with the two-photon coherences that create\ntwo-photon entangled states, and the other associated with populations of the\ncollective states. We find that the spin-squeezing parameter correctly predicts\nentanglement in the two-atom Dicke system only if it is associated with\ntwo-photon entangled states, but fails to predict entanglement when it is\nassociated with the entangled symmetric state. This explicitly identifies the\nsource of the discrepancy and explains why the system can be entangled without\nspin-squeezing. We illustrate these findings in three examples of the\ninteraction of the system with thermal, classical squeezed vacuum and quantum\nsqueezed vacuum fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Mar 2003 00:13:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
