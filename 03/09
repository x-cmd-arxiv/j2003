As a result these galaxies are\nslowly transformed within the cluster by gradual gas stripping processes,\nassociated truncation of star formation, and passive fading of stellar\npopulations. Low-mass early-type cluster galaxies are therefore currently being\nproduced as the product of cluster environmental effects.

It is proved for O(2), $O(3)=SO(3)$, SO(4), and O(4), that\nthere exists an $m$-linear invariant with $m$ arbitrarily large, which is not\nexpressible as a polynomial of invariants of lower degree. This is in sharp\ncontrast with the uniform description of the ring of invariants valid in all\nother characteristics, and supports the conjecture that the same phenomena\noccur for all $n$. For general even $n$, new O(n)-invariants are constructed,\nwhich are not expressible as polynomials of the quadratic invariants. In\ncontrast with these results, it is shown that rational invariants have a\nuniform description valid in all characteristics. Similarly, if $m \\leq n$,\nthen $R^O(n)$ is generated by the obvious invariants. For all $n$, the algebra\n$R^G$ is a finitely generated module over the subalgebra generated by the\nquadratic invariants, and for odd $n$, the square of any SO(n)-invariant is a\npolynomial of the quadratic invariants. Finally we mention that for even $n$,\nan $n$-linear SO(n)-invariant is given, which distinguishes between SO(n) and\nO(n) (just like the determinant in all characteristics different from 2).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Mar 2003 14:27:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 13 Sep 2003 13:18:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-31"}

This equation is special because the metric of\nthe space where it is written is influenced by the solution, rendering the\nequation recursive. The recursion mechanism is established via a first order\nequation which bears some resemblance to Dirac equation. In this paper the\nauthor limits the discussion to solutions with constant norm but makes use of\n4-dimensional hypercomplex numbers in matrix representation, a concept that is\nformally introduced in a section devoted to that aspect. The particular\nsolutions that are found exhibit symmetries that can be assigned to spin,\nelectric and color charges of elementary particles, leaving mass as a free\nparameter. Massless particles can also be assigned to special solutions of the\nsource equation, with the cases of photons, gluons and gravitons clearly\nidentified, together with another massless particle which does not seem to be\nrelated to anything detected experimentally. Another section deals with\nparticle dynamics under fields, showing that both gravitational and\nelectrodynamics can be modelled by geodesics of the spaces whose metric tensors\nresult from the recursion mechanism. Finally the author suggests two lines of\nfuture work, one deriving fields from densities and currents of masses and\ncharges and the other one aimed at determining particles' masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Mar 2003 21:00:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Apr 2003 08:39:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Here we show\nthat this problem can be surmounted, refuting a claim to the contrary by\nBenioff. In particular, we show how to search a d-dimensional hypercube in time\nO(sqrt n) for d at least 3, or O((sqrt n)(log n)^(3/2)) for d=2. More\ngenerally, we introduce a model of quantum query complexity on graphs,\nmotivated by fundamental physical limits on information storage, particularly\nthe holographic principle from black hole thermodynamics. Our results in this\nmodel include almost-tight upper and lower bounds for many search tasks; a\ngeneralized algorithm that works for any graph with good expansion properties,\nnot just hypercubes; and relationships among several notions of `locality' for\nunitary matrices acting on graphs.
