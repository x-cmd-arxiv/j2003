We show that the behavior of the Lagrangian dispersion of pairs\nof fluid particles in such models is determined by the scale dependence of the\nratio between the correlation time of velocity differences and the eddy\nturnover time. For a non-trivial scale dependence, the asymptotic regimes of\nthe dispersion at small and large scales are described by the models with\neither rapidly decorrelating or frozen velocities. In contrast to the\ndecorrelated case, known as the Kraichnan model and exhibiting Lagrangian flows\nwith deterministic or stochastic trajectories, fast separating or trapped\ntogether, the frozen model is poorly understood. We examine the pair dispersion\nbehavior in its simplest, one-dimensional version, reinforcing analytic\narguments by numerical analysis. The collected information about the pair\ndispersion statistics in the limiting models allows to partially predict the\nextent of different phases and the scaling properties of the Lagrangian flow in\nthe model with time-correlated velocities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Mar 2003 17:11:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
