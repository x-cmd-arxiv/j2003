We\nfind that a relatively high-mass protoplanetary disk ($\\sim$ 10$\\times$\nminimum-mass) is required to produce giant planet core-sized bodies ($\\sim$ 10\nM$_{\\oplus}$) within the lifetime of the nebular gas ($\\la$ 10 million years).\nHowever, an implausibly massive disk is needed to produce even an Earth mass at\nthe orbit of Uranus by 10 Myrs.

In the limit of\nnon-interacting planetesimals, a reasonable-mass disk is unable to produce\nbodies the size of the Solar System's two outer giant planets at their current\nlocations on {\\it any} timescale; if collisional damping of planetesimal random\nvelocities is sufficiently effective, though, it may be possible for a\nUranus/Neptune to form in situ in less than the age of the Solar System. We\nperform numerical simulations of oligarchic growth with gas, and find that\nprotoplanet growth rates agree reasonably well with the analytic model as long\nas protoplanet masses are well below their estimated final masses. However,\naccretion stalls earlier than predicted, so that the largest final protoplanet\nmasses are smaller than those given by the model.

The compound was\nfound to be cubic (S.G. P4_1 23) in the entire temperature range. However, the\nfully-ordered model of the crystal structure (no split sites) is marginal at\nroom temperature, and clearly fails at low temperature. A much better\ndescription of the crystal structure below 250K is given in terms of two split\nBa sites, with random occupancies, for two out of three types of cages present\nin the Ba6Ge25 structure. The Ba atoms were found to interact strongly with the\nGe host. The separation of the split Ba sites grows with decreasing\ntemperature, with a sudden increase on cooling through the 200-250K temperature\nrange, accompanied by an expansion of the entire crystal structure. We propose\na simple model for this transition, based on temperature-induced de- trapping\nof Ba from a deep double-well potential. This transition is associated with\nsizeable anomalies in the transport and magnetic properties. The most\nsignificant of these effects, that is, the drop in electrical conductivity on\ncooling, can be easily explained within our model through the enhanced\nstructural disorder, which would affect the relaxation time for all portions of\nthe Fermi surface. We suggest that the other anomalies (increase in the\nabsolute value of the negative Seebeck coefficient, decrease in the magnetic\nsusceptibility) can be explained within the framework of the one-electron semi-\nclassical model, without any need to invoke exotic electron-electron\ninteraction mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Mar 2003 11:08:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Similar to the case of a weak tunnel barrier, the shape\nof the charge step is governed at low temperatures by the non-Fermi-liquid\nfixed point of the two-channel Kondo effect. However, the associated Kondo\ntemperature TK is strongly modified. Most notably, TK is proportional to the\nwidth of the level if the transmission through the impurity is close to unity\nat the Fermi energy, and is no longer exponentially small in one over the\ntunneling matrix element.

For a large on-site repulsion and a large\nasymmetry in the tunneling rates to box and to the lead, there is a sequence of\nKondo effects: first the local magnetic moment that forms on the level\nundergoes single-channel screening, followed by two-channel overscreening of\nthe charge fluctuations inside the box.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Mar 2003 13:30:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
