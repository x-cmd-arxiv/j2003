(2) Tidal scattering of stars on the MBH. (3) Tidal heating of\ninspiraling stars - \"squeezars\" - that were tidally captured by the MBH. We\ndiscuss the implications for stellar populations near MBHs and for the growth\nof MBHs by tidal disruption of stars, and the possible observational signature\nof such processes near the MBH in the Galactic Center. We compare the event\nrates of prompt tidal encounters (tidal disruption and tidal scattering) and\nslow inspiral events (squeezars / tidal capture), and find that tidal capture\nis at least an order of magnitude less efficient than prompt disruption. This\nmeans that past studies, which assigned similar weights to prompt disruption\nand tidal capture, over-estimated the contribution of tidal disruption to the\ngrowth of the MBH by at least a factor of two.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Mar 2003 08:04:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The second summand is the\nsubspace of deformations of the double covering which induce trivial\ndeformations of the branch divisor. The main result of the paper is a\ndescription of the effect of imposing singularities in the branch locus.\n  As a special case we study deformations of Calabi--Yau threefolds which are\nnon--singular models of double cover of the projective 3--space branched along\nan octic surface. We show that in that case the number of deformations can be\ncomputed explicitly using computer algebra systems. This gives a method to\ncompute the Hodge numbers of these Calabi--Yau manifolds.

For this family of\nstates, other measures of entanglement, such as entanglement of formation and\nrelative entropy of entanglement, have not been determined. The results for the\ngeometric measure of entanglement are compared with those for negativity, which\nare also determined. The results for the geometric measure of entanglement and\nthe negativity provide examples of the determination of entanglement for\nnontrivial mixed multipartite states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Mar 2003 00:56:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In this paper, we describe the\nphysical properties of these devices, and show the mathematical derivations\nbased on the interaction of the laser field as control with atoms, ions or\nelectron spins, leading to the following: (i) the 1-bit unitary rotation gates;\nand (ii) the 2-bit quantum phase gates and the controlled-not gate.
