The models are the mean-field XY\nmodel and the one-dimensional XY model with nearest-neighbor interactions. The\nformer model undergoes a second-order phase transition at a finite critical\ntemperature while the latter has no phase transitions. The computation of this\ntopologic invariant is performed within the framework of Morse theory. In both\nmodels topology changes in configuration space are present as the potential\nenergy is varied; however, in the mean-field model there is a particularly\n\"strong\" topology change, corresponding to a big jump in the Euler\ncharacteristic, connected with the phase transition, which is absent in the\none-dimensional model with no phase transition. The comparison between the two\nmodels has two major consequences: i) it lends new and strong support to a\nrecently proposed topological approach to the study of phase transitions; ii)\nit allows us to conjecture which particular topology changes could entail a\nphase transition in general. We also discuss a simplified illustrative model of\nthe topology changes connected to phase transitions using of two-dimensional\nsurfaces, and a possible direct connection between topological invariants and\nthermodynamic quantities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Mar 2003 15:58:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

As usual, the ultrahigh energy protons with\nenergies above E_{GZK} ~ 4 x 10^{19} eV loose a large fraction of their\nenergies by the photoproduction of pions on the cosmic microwave background,\nwhich finally decay mainly into neutrinos. In our scenario, these so-called\ncosmogenic neutrinos interact with nucleons in the atmosphere through Standard\nModel electroweak instanton-induced processes and produce air showers which are\nhardly distinguishable from ordinary hadron-initiated air showers.
