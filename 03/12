We\ndetect synchrotron emission from Cas A in the near-infrared using Two Micron\nAll Sky Survey (2MASS) and Palomar 200 inch PFIRCAM observations. The remnant\nis detected in J, H, and Ks bands, with Ks band brightest and J faint. In the J\nand H bands, bright [Fe II] lines (1.24um and 1.64um) are detected\nspectroscopically. The Palomar observations include Ks continuum, narrow-band\n1.64um (centered on [Fe II]) and 2.12um (centered on H2(1-0)) images. While the\nnarrow-band 1.64um image shows filamentary and knotty structures, similar to\nthe optical image, the Ks image shows a relatively smooth, diffuse shell,\nremarkably similar to the radio image. The broad-band near-infrared fluxes of\nCas A are generally consistent with, but a few tens of percent higher than, an\nextrapolation of the radio fluxes. The hardening to higher frequencies is\npossibly due to nonlinear shock acceleration and/or spectral index variation\nacross the remnant. We show evidence of spectral index variation. The presence\nof near-infrared synchrotron radiation requires the roll-off frequency to be\nhigher than 1.5e14 Hz, implying that electrons are accelerated to energies of\nat least 0.2 TeV. The morphological similarity in diffuse emission between the\nradio and Ks band images implies that synchrotron losses are not dominant. Our\nobservations show unambiguous evidence that the near-infrared Ks band emission\nof Cas A is from synchrotron emission by accelerated cosmic-ray electrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Mar 2003 16:51:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Our analysis shows that: a) the southern nucleus is responsible for\nabout 80% of the total infrared luminosity of the system, b) the L-band\nluminosity in the southern nucleus is dominated by the emission from an\nobscured AGN, providing about 40 to 50% of the bolometric flux between 8 and\n1000 microns; c) the northern nucleus does not show evidence for AGN emission\nand appears to be in a post-starburst phase. As for the relative strengths of\nthe AGN and starburst components, we find that, while they are comparable at\nFIR and sub-mm wavelengths, in the radio the Sy2 emission dominates by an order\nof magnitude the starburst.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Mar 2003 15:33:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

As preparatory steps we begin with the 3d\nGross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), scale it to get a three-parameter model and\nshow how to reduce it to 2d and 1d GPEs. The ground state solution is\nformulated by minimizing the energy functional under a constraint, which is\ndiscretized by the finite element method. The finite element approximation for\n1d, 2d with radial symmetry and 3d with spherical symmetry and cylindrical\nsymmetry are presented in detail and approximate ground state solutions, which\nare used as initial guess in our practical numerical computation of the\nminimization problem, of the GPE in two extreme regimes: very weak interactions\nand strong repulsive interactions are provided. Numerical results in 1d, 2d\nwith radial symmetry and 3d with spherical symmetry and cylindrical symmetry\nfor atoms ranging up to millions in the condensation are reported to\ndemonstrate the novel numerical method. Furthermore, comparisons between the\nground state solutions and their Thomas-Fermi approximations are also reported.\nExtension of the numerical method to compute the excited states of GPE is also\npresented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Mar 2003 07:55:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

This is a generalization of\nan earlier analysis of waves propagating perpendicularly to B0 to include the\neffect of wavenumbers along B0. The Lie transformation technique is used to\ndevelop a perturbation theory describing the ion motion, and results are\ncompared with numerical solutions of the complete equations of motion. Coherent\nenergization occurs when the Doppler-shifted wave frequencies differ by nearly\nan integer multiple of the ion cyclotron frequency. When the difference in the\nparallel wavenumbers of the two waves is increased the coherent energization of\nions is limited to a small part of the phase space. The energization of ions\nand its dependence on wave parameters is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Mar 2003 01:43:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Jul 2003 20:34:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
