We predict galaxy luminosity functions in preheated\nuniverses. The results depend crucially on whether the baryonic smoothing scale\nin the IGM is computed globally, or in a local, density-dependent fashion.\nUsing a globally averaged smoothing scale, we find that models with excessive\npreheating produce too few L_* and fainter galaxies, and are therefore\ninconsistent with observational data. A density-dependent smoothing scale\nrequires more energetic preheating to achieve the same degree of suppression in\nthe faint-end slope. All models, however, appear unable to explain the sharp\ncut-off in the luminosity function at bright magnitudes.

Exploiting known results of an effective field theory\nwhich separates hard (order 2 pi T) and soft (order gT) contributions, we\nexplore the accuracy of simple resummations which at a given loop order\nsystematically treat hard contributions strictly perturbatively, but soft\ncontributions without truncations. This turns out to improve significantly the\ntwo-loop and the three-loop results in that both remain below the ideal-gas\nvalue, and the degree of renormalization scale dependence decreases as one goes\nfrom two to three loop order, whereas it increases in the conventional\nperturbative results. Including the four-loop logarithms recently obtained by\nKajantie et al., we find that this trend continues and that with a particular\nsublogarithmic constant the untruncated four-loop result is close to the\nthree-loop result, which itself agrees well with available lattice results down\nto temperatures of about 2.5 T_c. We also investigate the possibility of\noptimization by using a variational (``screened'') perturbation theory in the\neffective theory. At two loops, this gives a result below the ideal gas value,\nand also closer to lattice results than the recent two-loop\nhard-thermal-loop-screened result of Andersen et al. While at three-loop order\nthe gap equation of dimensionally reduced screened perturbation theory does not\nhave a solution in QCD, this is remedied upon inclusion of the four-loop\nlogarithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Mar 2003 15:54:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Mar 2003 19:30:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 May 2003 08:29:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We\nemphasize that the form of the solitary potential is not tightly constrained,\nand the amplitude and widths of the potential are constrained by inequalities.\nThe existence of a continuous range of allowed sizes and shapes for these waves\nmakes them easily accessible. We propose that these solitary waves can be\nspontaneously generated in turbulence or thermal fluctuations. We expect that\nthe high excitation probability of these waves should alter the bulk properties\nof the plasma medium such as electrical resistivity and thermal conductivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Mar 2003 21:49:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Oct 2003 13:56:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
