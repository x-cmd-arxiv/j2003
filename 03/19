We have studied the magnetic properties of SmCo5 using\ndensity functional theory (DFT) calculations where the Sm f-bands, which are\ndifficult to include in DFT calculations, have been treated within the LDA+U\nformalism. The large MAE comes mostly from the Sm f-shell anisotropy, stemming\nfrom an interplay between the crystal field and the spin-orbit coupling. We\nfound that both are of similar strengths, unlike some other Sm compounds,\nleading to a partial quenching of the orbital moment (f-states cannot be\ndescribed as either pure lattice harmonics or pure complex harmonics), an\noptimal situation for enhanced MAE. A smaller portion of the MAE can be\nassociated with the Co-d band anisotropy, related to the peak in the density of\nstates at the Fermi energy. Our result for the MAE of SmCo5, 21.6 meV/f.u.,\nagrees reasonably with the experimental value of 13-16 meV/f.u., and the\ncalculated magnetic moment (including the orbital component) of 9.4 mu_B agrees\nwith the experimental value of 8.9 mu_B.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Mar 2003 21:35:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

In the infrared s-->0 limit the\nperturbative correction to the parton model result for R(e+e-) has an\nall-orders perturbation theory component which smoothly freezes to the value\nR(0)=2/b, where b=(33-2Nf)/6 is the first QCD beta-function coefficient with Nf\nflavours of massless quarks. For freezing one requires Nf<9. The freezing\nbehaviour is manifested by the ``contour-improved'' or ``Analytic Perturbation\nTheory'' (APT), in which an infinite subset of analytical continuation terms\nare resummed to all-orders. We show that for the Euclidean Adler-D function,\nD(Q^2), the perturbative component remains defined into the infrared provided\nthat ALL the renormalon singularities care taken into account, but no analogue\nof the APT reorganisation of perturbation theory is possible.
