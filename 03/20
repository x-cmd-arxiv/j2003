For the\nfirst time, we test this hypothesis through a comparison of predicted thermal\nSunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect scaling relations with available data from the\nliterature. One of the relations that we explore, in principle, depends solely\non SZ effect observations, thus offering an X-ray independent probe of the ICM.\nA detailed comparison of the theoretical relations with the largest compilation\nof high redshift SZ effect data to date indicates that the presence of an\nentropy floor is favored by the data. Furthermore, the inferred level of that\nfloor, 300 keV cm^2 or higher, is comparable to that found in studies of X-ray\nscaling relations of nearby massive clusters. Thus, we find no evidence for\nsignificant evolution of the entropy floor out to z = 0.7. We further\ndemonstrate that the high quality data to be obtained from the upcoming\nSunyaev-Zeldovich Array (SZA) and the (soon-to-be) upgraded Owens Valley Radio\nObservatory (OVRO) array will open powerful new windows into the properties of\nthe ICM. Specifically, the new measurements will allow for accurate\nmeasurements of the ICM entropy for even the most distant galaxy clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Mar 2003 00:29:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Mar 2003 20:16:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

This\nhappens because during the cool phases of the hydrodynamical simulations the CO\nnumber density in the outer atmospheric regions is smaller than what is\nstipulated by the ICE approximation, resulting in decreased CO opacity in the\nsolar chromosphere. As a result, the cool CO-bearing gas which produces the\nobserved molecular lines must be located at atmospheric heights not greater\nthan 700 km, approximately.

It can also be seen\nin the Knight shift, photoemission and tunneling experiments. In underdoped\nsamples it appears near room temperature and does not close with temperature.\nAnother related phenomenon that has been studied by infrared is the depression\nin the ab-plane scattering rate. Two separate effects can be discerned. At high\ntemperatures there is broad depression of scattering below 1000 cm-1 which may\nbe related to the gap in the density of states. At a lower temperature a\nsharper structure is seen, which appears to be associated with scattering from\na mode at 300 cm-1, and which governs the carrier life time at low\ntemperatures. This mode shows up in a number of other experiments, as a kink in\nARPES dispersion, and a resonance at 41 meV in magnetic neutron scattering.\nSince the infrared technique can be used on a wide range of samples it has\nprovided evidence that the scattering mode is present in all high temperature\ncuprates and that its frequency in optimally doped materials scales with the\nsuperconducting transition temperature. The lanthanum and neodymium based\ncuprates do not follow this scaling and appear to have depressed transition\ntemperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Mar 2003 19:24:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

For magnetic fields above 4.5 T, sharp features in the normal\nstate electrical resistivity, magnetization, specific heat, and thermal\nexpansion data suggest the occurrence of a phase transition at high fields.\nThis high field ordered phase in the normal state may originate from a\ncombination of crystalline electric field enhanced Zeeman splitting and\nquadrupolar ordering. We present an investigation of the electrical resistivity\nand magnetization of PrOs4Sb12 as a function of temperature between {350 mK}\nand {3.5 K} and magnetic field up to {18 T}. The data reveal a detailed phase\nboundary of the high field ordered phase as well as the lower critical field\n$H_{c1}$ and the onset field of the peak effect in the superconducting state of\nPrOs4Sb12.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Mar 2003 02:51:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In cases\nwhere the targets move independently, each target can instead be tracked with a\nseparate filter. However, this leads to a model-data association problem.\nAnother approach to solve the problem with computational complexity is to track\nonly the first moment of the joint distribution, the probability hypothesis\ndensity (PHD). The integral of this distribution over any area S is the\nexpected number of targets within S. Since no record of object identity is\nkept, the model-data association problem is avoided.\n  The contribution of this paper is a particle filter implementation of the PHD\nfilter mentioned above. This PHD particle filter is applied to tracking of\nmultiple vehicles in terrain, a non-linear tracking problem. Experiments show\nthat the filter can track a changing number of vehicles robustly, achieving\nnear-real-time performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Mar 2003 13:48:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

For that the flat direction energy\ndensity has to dominate the Universe at the time when it decays. We point out\nthat this is not possible if the inflaton decays into MSSM degrees of freedom.\nIf the inflaton is completely in the hidden sector, its decay products do not\ncouple to the flat direction, and the flat direction curvaton can dominate the\nenergy density. This requires the absence of a Hubble-induced mass for the\ncurvaton, e.g. by virtue of the Heisenberg symmetry. In the case of hidden\nradiation, $n=9$ is the only admissible direction; for other hidden equations\nof state, directions with lower $n$ may also dominate. We show that the MSSM\ncurvaton is further constrained severely by the damping of the fluctuations,\nand as an example, demonstrate that in no-scale supergravity it would fragment\ninto $Q$ balls rather than decay. Damping of fluctuations can be avoided by an\ninitial condition, which for the $n=9$ direction would require an initial\ncurvaton amplitude of $\\sim 10^{-2}M_p$, thereby providing a working example of\nthe MSSM flat direction curvaton.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Mar 2003 16:31:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Using data from the recent solar neutrino and KamLAND\nexperiments we provide stringent limits on solar density fluctuations. It is\nshown that the neutrino data constrains solar density fluctuations to be less\nthan beta = 0.05 at the 70 % confidence level, where beta is the fractional\nfluctuation around the value given by the Standard Solar Model. We find that\nthe best fit to the combined solar neutrino and KamLAND data is given by beta =\n0.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Mar 2003 21:15:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

First, are proposed\nnew generalized Verma modules. They are called k-Verma modules, k\\in N, and\ncoincide with the usual Verma modules for k=1.

The second development is the proposal of a procedure\nfor the construction of multilinear intertwining differential operators for\nsemisimple Lie groups G . This procedure uses k-Verma modules and coincides for\nk=1 with a procedure for the construction of linear intertwining differential\noperators. For all k central role is played by the singular vectors of the\nk-Verma modules. Explicit formulae for series of such singular vectors are\ngiven. Using these are given explicitly many new examples of multilinear\nintertwining differential operators.

It is found that the relative\nweight of the rescattering steadily grows with $x$ becoming of the order of\nunity at $x>1.4\\div 1.5$. At such values of $x$ the finite formation time\neffects become fairly visible, which may serve for their study at relatively\nsmall value of the four-momentum transfer$Q^2$. The relativistic rescattering\ncontribution is compared with the Glauber rescattering, which is shown to be\nnot valid in the cumulative region starting from $x>1.4$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Mar 2003 20:35:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}
