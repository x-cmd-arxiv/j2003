A mid-UV to optical/IR wavelength\nbaseline provides good separation of population components because the main\nsequence turnoff dominates the integrated light between 2500 and 4000 A. We\nfind a six magnitude difference in the mid-UV continuum level over the\nmetallicity range -1.5 < log Z/Z_o < +0.5 and a comparable difference (per unit\nlog t) for ages in the range 4-16 Gyr. Logarithmic derivatives of mid-UV colors\nwith respect to age or metal abundance are 3-10 times larger than for the UBV\nregion. Most of the spectral information on old populations therefore resides\nbelow 4000 A. We investigate the capability of UBV and mid-UV broad-band colors\nto separately determine age and abundance, taking into account precision in the\ncolor measurements.

The\ndisk affects the spectral energy distribution most strongly at edge-on\ninclinations, causing a broad dip at about 10 um (independent of the silicate\nfeature) due to high extinction and low scattering albedo in this wavelength\nregion. The bipolar cavities allow more direct stellar+disk radiation to emerge\ninto polar directions, and more scattering radiation to emerge into all\ndirections. The wavelength-integrated flux, often interpreted as luminosity,\nvaries with viewing angle, with pole-on viewing angles seeing 2-4 times as much\nflux as edge-on, depending on geometry. Thus, observational estimates of\nluminosity should take into account the inclination of a source.

The most recent determination of {\\dot P} = (2.3 \\pm 1.4) *\n10^{-15} s/s^{-1} for the 215.2s fundamental mode agrees very well with\npredictions of the best fit theoretical model. The rate of change of the\noscillation period can be explained by two effects: the cooling (dominant\nfactor) and change of gravitational binding energy (residual gravitational\ncontraction). Since the white dwarfs are pulsating in g-modes whose frequencies\nare related to the Brunt-Vaisala frequency (explicitly dependent on G)\nobservational determination of the change of the period (more precisely the\ndifference between observed and calculated \\dot P) can be used to set the upper\nbound on the rate of change of G.

The ratio of carbon to oxygen at the end of helium burning is\ncrucial for understanding the final fate of a progenitor star and the\nnucleosynthesis of heavy elements in Type II supernova, with oxygen rich star\npredicted to collapse to a black hole, and a carbon rich star to a neutron\nstar. Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa) are used as standard candles for measuring\ncosmological distances with the use of an empirical light curve-luminosity\nstretching factor. It is essential to understand helium burning that yields the\ncarbon/oxygen white dwarf and thus the initial stage of SNeIa. Since the triple\nalpha-particle capture reaction, $^{8}Be(\\alpha,\\gamma)^{12}C$, the first\nburning stage in helium burning, is well understood, one must extract the cross\nsection of the $^{12}C(\\alpha,\\gamma)^{16}O$ reaction at the Gamow window (300\nkeV) with high accuracy of approximately 10% or better.

If filament compliance and the discrete nature of\nthe binding sites are taken into account, the negative slope is diminished, but\nnot eliminated. This implies that there is an instability in the dynamics of\nindividual half-sarcomeres. However, when the symmetric nature of whole\nsarcomeres is taken into account, filament rearrangement becomes important\nduring the transient: as tension is recovered, some half-sarcomeres lengthen\nwhile others shorten. This leads to a flat T2 curve, as observed\nexperimentally. In addition, we investigate the isotonic transient response and\nshow that for a range of parameter values the model displays damped\noscillations, as recently observed in experiments on single muscle fibers.
