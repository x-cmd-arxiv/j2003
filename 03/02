We study how it might arrive at such an orbit and how it has\navoided being tidally circularized until now. The presence of a stellar\ncompanion to the host star suggests the possibility that the Kozai mechanism\nand tidal dissipation combined to draw the planet inward well after it formed:\nKozai oscillations produce periods of extreme eccentricity in the planet orbit,\nand the tidal dissipation that occurs during these periods of small pericentre\ndistances leads to gradual orbital decay. We call this migration mechanism the\n'Kozai migration'. It requires that the initial planet orbit is highly inclined\nrelative to the binary orbit. For a companion at 1000 AU and an initial planet\norbit at 5 AU, the minimum relative inclination required is ~ 85. We discuss\nthe efficiency of tidal dissipation inferred from the observations of\nexo-planets. Moreover, we investigate possible explanations for the velocity\nresidual (after the motion induced by the planet is removed) observed on the\nhost star: a second planet in the system is excluded over a large extent of\nsemi-major axis space if Kozai migration is to work, and the tide raised on the\nstar by HD 80606b is likely too small in amplitude.

Here, we address the question of how best to\ntake advantage of cold atom properties to perform the observation of as highly\nforbidden a line as the 6S-7S Cs transition for achieving, in the longer term,\nAtomic Parity Violation measurements in radioactive alkali isotopes. Another\npoint at issue is whether one might do better with stable, cold atoms than with\nthermal atoms. To compensate for the large drawback of the small number of\natoms available in a trap, one must take advantage of their low velocity. To\nlengthen the time of interaction with the excitation laser, we suggest choosing\na geometry where the laser beam exciting the transition is colinear to a slow,\ncold atomic beam, either extracted from a trap or prepared by Zeeman slowing.\nWe also suggest a new observable physical quantity manifesting APV, which\npresents several advantages:specificity, efficiency of detection, possibility\nof direct calibration by a parity conserving quantity of a similar nature. It\nis well adapted to a configuration where the cold atomic beam passes through\ntwo regions of transverse, crossed electric fields, leading both to\ndifferential measurements and to strong reduction of the contributions from the\nM_1-Stark interference signals, potential sources of systematics in APV\nmeasurements.
