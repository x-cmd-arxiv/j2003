Our\nfundamental assumption is that the angular momenta of binary star systems is\ndirectly related to the net angular momentum induced by turbulence in parent\nmolecular cloud cores. The primary results of this model are as follows. (i) A\nquantitative prediction of the initial width of the binary period distribution\n($\\sigma_{\\log {P}_d} = 1.6 - 2.1$ for a star formation efficiency in the range\n$\\epsilon_* = 0.1 - 0.9$). (ii) A robust, negative anticorrelation of binary\nperiod and mass ratio. (iii) A robust, positive correlation of binary period\nand eccentricity. (iv) A robust prediction that the binary separation of\nlow-mass systems should be more closely separated than those of solar-mass or\nlarger. These predictions are in good agreement with observations of PMS binary\nsystems with periods $P > 10^3$ d, which account for the majority of all\nbinaries.\n  We conclude with a brief discussion of the implications of our results for\nobservational and theoretical studies of multiple star formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Mar 2003 20:37:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

One is that the ring is a\ntransitory, localized radial density enhancement reflecting the apocenter of\nparticles stripped from a satellite during a recent pericentric passage (a\n``tidal arc'' reminiscent of the tidal arms seen in disk galaxy mergers). In\nthe second scenario, the ring is analogous to the ``shells'' found around some\nelliptical galaxies, and would result from a minor merger that took place\nseveral Gyr ago. The two interpretations differ in several ways. Tidal arcs are\nexpected to span a limited longitude range; may carry a substantial fraction of\nthe original mass of the satellite; should exhibit a significant velocity\ngradient with Galactic longitude; and are in all likelihood asymmetric above\nand below the plane of the disk. Shells, on the other hand, may comprise at\nmost a small fraction of the original mass of the satellite and, due to their\nmore relaxed state, ought to be symmetric above and below the plane, with no\ndiscernible velocity gradients across the structure.

This is applied to critical models, like O(N) and Potts\nmodels, and to the Stochastic L\\\"owner Evolution (SLE).

In this\npaper, by explicitly constructing multisoliton solutions (upto four-soliton\nsolutions) for two coupled and arbitrary $N$-coupled nonlinear Schr{\\\"o}dinger\nequations using the Hirota bilinearization method, we bring out clearly the\nvarious features underlying the fascinating shape changing (intensity\nredistribution) collisions of solitons, including changes in amplitudes, phases\nand relative separation distances, and the very many possibilities of energy\nredistributions among the modes of solitons. However in this multisoliton\ncollision process the pair-wise collision nature is shown to be preserved in\nspite of the changes in the amplitudes and phases of the solitons. Detailed\nasymptotic analysis also shows that when solitons undergo multiple collisions,\nthere exists the exciting possibility of shape restoration of atleast one\nsoliton during interactions of more than two solitons represented by three and\nhigher order soliton solutions. From application point of view, we have shown\nfrom the asymptotic expressions how the amplitude (intensity) redistribution\ncan be written as a generalized linear fractional transformation for the\n$N$-component case. Also we indicate how the multisolitons can be reinterpreted\nas various logic gates for suitable choices of the soliton parameters, leading\nto possible multistate logic. In addition, we point out that the various\nrecently studied partially coherent solitons are just special cases of the\nbright soliton solutions exhibiting shape changing collisions, thereby\nexplaining their variable profile and shape variation in collision process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Mar 2003 05:31:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
