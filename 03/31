The\nprobability distribution functions (PDFs) of the local power are long-tailed.\nThe power on small scales is dominated by small probability events, and\nconsequently, the uncertainty in the power spectrum of the transmitted flux\nfield is generally large. This uncertainty arises due to the slow convergence\nof an intermittent field to a Gaussian limit required by the central limit\ntheorem (CLT). To reduce this uncertainty, it is common to estimate the error\nof the power spectrum by selecting subsamples with an \"optimal\" size. We show\nthat this conventional method actually does not calculate the variance of the\noriginal intermittent field but of a Gaussian field. Based on the analysis of\nintermittency, we propose an algorithm to calculate the error. It is based on a\nbootstrap re-sampling among all independent local power modes. This estimation\ndoesn't require any extra parameter like the size of the subsamples, and is\nsensitive to the intermittency of the fields.

Indeed, the evolution of the radial\ndistribution of solids is governed by many processes: gas-solid coupling,\ncoagulation, sedimentation, evaporation/condensation, so that the distribution\nof planetesimals emerging from a turbulent disk does not necessarily reflect\nthat of gas.

Two\ncases are considered: the chain is connected to electrodes and in the other\ncase the chain is confined giving zero dc conduction. The concentration of\ncharge is varied using a gate electrode. At low temperatures and with the\npresence of an injection barrier, the mobility is an oscillatory function of\ndensity. This is due to the phenomenon of charge density pinning. Mobility\nchanges occur due to the co-operative pinning and unpinning of the\ndistribution. At high temperatures, we find that the electron-electron\ninteraction reduces the mobility monotonically with density, but perhaps not as\nmuch as one might intuitively expect because the path summation favour the\nin-phase contributions to the mobility, i.e. the sequential paths in which the\ncarriers have to wait for the one in front to exit and so on. The carrier\ninteractions produce a frequency dependent mobility which is of the same order\nas the change in the dc mobility with density, i.e. it is a comparably weak\neffect. However, when combined with an injection barrier or intrinsic disorder,\nthe interactions reduce the free volume and amplify disorder by making it\nnon-local and this can explain the too early onset of frequency dependence in\nthe conductivity of some high mobility quasi-one-dimensional organic materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Mar 2003 09:22:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We find that if quantum error correction can be used, so that noise\nlevels can be made arbitrarily small, then reasonable security conditions for\ncoin tossing can be framed so that results from the noiseless case will\ncontinue to hold. If, however, error correction is not available (as is the\ncase with present day technology), and significant noise is present, then\ntossing a single coin becomes problematic. In this case, we are led to consider\nrandom n-bit string generation in the presence of noise, rather than\nsingle-shot coin tossing. We introduce precise security criteria for n-bit\nstring generation and describe an explicit protocol that could be implemented\nwith present day technology. In general, a cheater can exploit noise in order\nto bias coins to their advantage. We derive explicit upper bounds on the\naverage bias achievable by a cheater for given noise levels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Mar 2003 11:57:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Apr 2003 11:08:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 22 Oct 2003 15:51:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 2004 13:47:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
