In\nthis case the emission is due to Compton scattering off seed photons provided\nby the Cosmic Microwave Background, and this on one hand permits to have\nmagnetic fields close to equipartition with the emitting particles, and on the\nother hand minimizes the requirements about the total power carried by the jet.\nThe emission comes from compact (kpc scale) knots, and we here investigate what\nwe can predict about the possible emission between the bright knots. This is\nmotivated by the fact that bulk relativistic motion makes Compton scattering\noff the CMB photons efficient even when electrons are cold or mildly\nrelativistic in the comoving frame.

In\nthe wedge geometry, there is a strong attraction beyond the corresponding one\nnear a planar wall that significantly influences the structure of colloidal\nsuspensions in wedges. In accordance with an experimental study, for the edge\ngeometry we find a free energy barrier of the order of several $k_B T$ which\nrepels a big colloidal particle from the edge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Mar 2003 13:17:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The fiber orientation and deformation are additional variables in\nthe domain of field quantities. The new field quantities on the enlarged set of\nvariables obey balance equations. The mesoscopic balance of mass results in an\nequation of motion for the distribution of fiber orientations and deformations.\nThe usual macroscopic fields of continuum mechanics are averages of mesoscopic\nfields over the different orientations and deformations.

Our approach is fundamentally different as it identifies ideal points\ndirectly as appropriate pairs consisting of a (perhaps empty) future set and a\n(perhaps empty) past set. These future and past sets are just the future and\npast of the ideal point within the original spacetime. This provides our\nconstruction with useful causal properties and leads to more satisfactory\nresults in a number of examples. We are also able to endow the completion with\na topology.

However, even allowing for\ndiscreteness effects one can distinguish between orbits which, in the continuum\nlimit, feel a regular potential, so that emittance grows as a power law in\ntime, and chaotic orbits, where emittance grows exponentially. For sufficiently\nlarge N, one can distinguish two different `kinds' of chaos. Short range\nmicrochaos, associated with close encounters between charges, is a generic\nfeature, yielding large positive Lyapunov exponents X_N which do not decrease\nwith increasing N even if the bulk potential is integrable. Alternatively,\nthere is the possibility of larger scale macrochaos, characterised by smaller\nLyapunov exponents X_S, which is present only if the bulk potential is chaotic.\nConventional computations of Lyapunov exponents probe X_N, leading to the\noxymoronic conclusion that N-body orbits which look nearly regular and have\nsharply peaked Fourier spectra are `very chaotic.' However, the `range' of the\nmicrochaos, set by the typical interparticle spacing, decreases as N increases,\nso that, for large N, this microchaos, albeit very strong, is largely\nirrelevant macroscopically. A more careful numerical analysis allows one to\nestimate both X_N and X_S.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Mar 2003 19:13:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
