The faint-end of\nthe LFs is consistent with the local estimates, with no evidence for a change\neither in the slope or normalization up to z<1.3. Viceversa, the density of\nluminous galaxies (M_Ks-5logh_70<-25.5) is higher than locally at all z and\nrelatively constant or mildly increasing with z within our sample. The data are\nconsistent with a mild luminosity evolution both in the J and Ks-band up to\nz=1.5 (DeltaM_J=-0.69+-0.12 and DeltaM_K=-0.54+-0.12 at z=1). Moreover, we find\nthat red and early-type galaxies dominate the bright-end of the LF, and that\ntheir number density shows at most a small decrease (<30%) up to z=1, thus\nsuggesting that massive elliptical galaxies were already in place at z=1 and\nthey should have formed their stars and assembled their mass at higher z. There\nappears to be a correlation of the optical/near-IR colors with near-IR\nluminosities, the most luminous/massive galaxies being red/old. We find a slow\nevolution with z of the near-IR comoving luminosity density to z=1.5. Finally,\nwe show that hierarchical models overpredict significantly the density of low\nluminosity galaxies at z<=1 and underpredict the density of luminous galaxies\nat z>=1, whereas PLE models are more consistent with the data up to z=1.5. The\nGIF model (Kaufmann et al. 1999) shows a clear deficiency of red luminous\ngalaxies at z=1 compared to our observations and predicts a decrease of\nluminous galaxies with z not observed in our sample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Feb 2003 18:02:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Apr 2003 14:02:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

In the near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams\nprovided by the 2MASS and DENIS surveys, the LMC C-type stars draw a striking\nred tail, well separated from the sequences of O-rich giants. So far, this\nconspicuous feature has been absent from any set of available isochrones, even\nthe few existing ones that include the TP-AGB evolution of low- and\nintermediate-mass stars. To investigate such issue we simulate the complete\n2MASS Ks vs.(J-Ks) data towards the LMC by means of a population synthesis\napproach, that relies on extended libraries of published stellar evolutionary\ntracks, including the TP-AGB phase. The simulations provide quite a detailed\ndescription of the several vertical fingers and inclined sequences seen in\n2MASS data, due to both Galactic foreground and LMC O-rich stars. Instead, as\nmentioned, the red tail of C-stars sets a major difficulty: we find that TP-AGB\nmodels with solar-scaled molecular opacities, the usual assumption of existing\nAGB calculations, do not succeed in reproducing this feature. Our tests\nindicate that the main reason for this failure should not be ascribed to\nempirical Teff - (J-K) transformations for C-type stars. Instead, the\ndiscrepancy is simply removed by adopting new evolutionary models that account\nfor the changes in molecular opacities as AGB stars get enriched in carbon via\nthe third dredge-up (Marigo 2002). In fact, simulations that adopt these models\nare able to reproduce, for the first time, the red tail of C-stars in\nnear-infrared CMDs. Finally, we point out that these simulations also provide\nuseful indications about the efficiency of the third dredge-up process, and the\npulsation modes of long-period variables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Feb 2003 16:13:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-23"}

Although there is no statistically significant variation\nof Tc with distance from the dominant ionizing star theta1-Ori-C, we find small\nscale variations in the plane of the sky down to a few arcseconds that are\ncompatible with the variations inferred from comparing the value of Te derived\nfrom forbidden and recombination lines, commonly known as the t^2 problem. We\npresent other evidence for fine scale variations in conditions in the nebula,\nthese being variations in the surface brightness of the the nebula,\nfluctuations in radial velocities, and ionization changes. From our Tc map and\nother considerations we estimate that t^2=0.028 +-0.006 for the Orion nebula.\nShadowed regions behind clumps close to the ionization front can make a\nsignificant contribution to the observed temperature fluctuations, but they\ncannot account for the t^2 values inferred from several methods of temperature\ndetermination. It is shown that an anomalous broadening of nebular emission\nlines appears to have the same sense of correlation as the temperature\nanomalies, although a causal link is not obvious.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Mar 2003 01:25:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The key ingredient of the model is the gap region (i.e. the region\nwhere particle acceleration is taking place and high-energy photons originate)\nwhich satisfies the following assumptions: i) the gap region extends from each\npolar cap to the light cylinder; ii) the gap is thin and confined to the\nsurface of last open magnetic-field lines; iii) photon emissivity is uniform\nwithin the gap region. The model lightcurves are dominated by strong peaks\n(either double or single) of caustic origin. Unlike in other pulsar models with\ncaustic effects, the double peaks arise due to crossing two caustics, each of\nwhich is associated with a different magnetic pole. The generic features of the\nlightcurves are consistent with the observed characteristics of pulsar\nlightcurves: 1) the most natural (in terms of probability) shape consists of\ntwo peaks (separated by 0.4 to 0.5 in phase for large viewing angles); 2) the\npeaks posess well developed wings; 3) there is a bridge (inter-peak) emission\ncomponent; 4) there is a non-vanishing off-pulse emission level; 5) the radio\npulse occurs before the leading high-energy peak. The model is well suited for\nfour gamma-ray pulsars - Crab, Vela, Geminga and B1951+32 - with double-peak\nlightcurves exhibiting the peak separation of 0.4 to 0.5 in phase.

In terms of\nrelativity, however, the state of rest cannot be reasonably defined for luxons\nand tachyons, and, therefore, today it does not make sense to speak of rest\nmass of such objects. It is shown here that the phrases \"negative squared\nmass\", \"imaginary mass\", and \"photon's zero mass\" result from applying\nbradyonic dynamical relativistic relations to determine properties of luxons\nand tachyons; and that this erroneous procedure results from an unfortunate\ninterpretation of kinematical relativistic relations.
