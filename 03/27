We argue\nthat in most realistic models of inflation the coupling of the inflaton to\nnormal matter is determined by the vacuum expectation values of fields in the\ntheory. If those fields are light during inflation (this is a generic situation\nin the minimal models of supersymmetric inflation) they will fluctuate leading\nto density perturbations through the proposed mechanism. We show that these\nfluctuations could easily dominate over the ones generated through the standard\nmechanism. The new scenario has several consequences for inflation model\nbuilding and observations. The proposed mechanism allows to generate the\nobserved level of density perturbations with a much lower scale of inflation\nand thus generically predicts a smaller level of gravitational waves. The\nrelation between the slope of the spectrum of the produced density\nperturbations and the potential of the inflaton field is different from the\nstandard relations obtained in the context of slow roll inflation. Because the\nfield responsible for the fluctuations is not the inflaton, it can have\nsignificantly larger self couplings and thus density perturbations could be\nnon-Gaussian. The non-Gaussianity can be large enough to be detectable by CMB\nand Large Scale Structure observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Mar 2003 20:33:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The\nnoise measurements were made using an ac bias with and without a dc bias\ncurrent imposed on it.

The detailed consideration of the spin degrees of\nfreedom allows to discern the way in which the SU(2) spin invariance is\npreserved in the renormalization process. Regarding the spin correlations, we\nfind two different universality classes which correspond, in the context of the\nextended Hubbard model, to having the bare on-site interaction $U$ repulsive or\nattractive. The first class is characterized by a spin instability which\ndevelops through the condensation of particle-hole pairs with momentum ${\\bf\nQ}$, with the disappearance of the Fermi line in the neighborhood of the\nsaddle-points. Within that class, the attractive or repulsive character of the\nnearest-neighbor interaction $V$ dictates whether there is or not a d-wave\nsuperconducting instability in the system. For the Hubbard model with just\non-site interaction, we show that some of the irrelevant operators are able to\ntrigger the superconducting instability.

We propose a mechanism that\nprovides local cancellation of all gauge and mixed gauge-gravitational\nanomalies, i.e. separately for each conical singularity. It is similar in\nspirit to the one used to cancel the normal bundle anomaly in the presence of\nfive-branes. It involves smoothly cutting off all fields close to the conical\nsingularities, resulting in an anomalous variation of the 3-form C and of the\nnon-abelian gauge fields present if there are also ADE singularities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Mar 2003 13:37:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Mar 2003 17:15:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 4 Sep 2003 19:54:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-05"}

For example, the 722 kg Voyager spacecraft required\n13,600 kg of propellant to launch and would take about 80,000 years to reach\nthe nearest star, Proxima Centauri, about 4.3 light years away. There have been\nvarious attempts at developing ideas on which one might base a spacecraft that\nwould permit deep space travel, such as spacewarps. In this paper we consider\nanother suggestion from science fiction and explore how the quantum vacuum\nmight be utilized in the creation of a novel spacecraft. The spacecraft is\nbased on the dynamic Casimir effect, in which electromagnetic radiation is\nemitted when an uncharged mirror is properly accelerated in the vacuum. The\nradiative reaction produces a dissipative force on the mirror that tends to\nresist the acceleration of the mirror. This force can be used to accelerate a\nspacecraft attached to the mirror. We also show that, in principal, one could\nobtain the power to operate the accelerated mirror in such a spacecraft using\nenergy extracted from the quantum vacuum using the standard Casimir effect\nwitha parallel plate geometry. Unfortunately the method as currently conceived\ngenerates a miniscule thrust, and is no more practical than a spacewarp, yet it\ndoes provide an interesting demonstration of our current understanding of the\nphysics of the quantized electromagnetic field in vacuum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Mar 2003 18:13:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-06"}

We propose a new application of this resource to\nthe theory of quantum measurements. According to Naimark's theorem any rank 1\ngeneralised measurement (POVM) M may be represented as a von Neumann\nmeasurement in an extended (tensor product) space of the system plus ancilla.\nBy considering a suitable average of the entanglements of these measurement\ndirections and minimising over all Naimark extensions, we define a notion of\nentanglement cost E_min(M) of M.\n  We give a constructive means of characterising all Naimark extensions of a\ngiven POVM. We identify various classes of POVMs with zero and non-zero cost\nand explicitly characterise all POVMs in 2 dimensions having zero cost. We\nprove a constant upper bound on the entanglement cost of any POVM in any\ndimension. Hence the asymptotic entanglement cost (i.e. the large n limit of\nthe cost of n applications of M, divided by n) is zero for all POVMs.\n  The trine measurement is defined by three rank 1 elements, with directions\nsymmetrically placed around a great circle on the Bloch sphere. We give an\nanalytic expression for its entanglement cost. Defining a normalised cost of\nany d-dimensional POVM by E_min(M)/log(d), we show (using a combination of\nanalytic and numerical techniques) that the trine measurement is more costly\nthan any other POVM with d>2, or with d=2 and ancilla dimension 2. This\nstrongly suggests that the trine measurement is the most costly of all POVMs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Mar 2003 12:24:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-01"}
