Assuming that this soft X-ray variability\nexponential time-scale is approximately equal to the thermal timescale of the\nstandard accretion disk, we obtain the accretion rate, the size of soft x-ray\nradiation region and the compactness parameter for 37 AGNs, using their\nrecently estimated central black hole masses. For 12 of these 37 AGNs, the\nradii of the gravitational instability in the standard thin accretion disks are\nobtained using central black hole masses and the calculated accretion rates.\nThese are consistent with the results from the reverberation mapping method.\nThese results provide supporting evidence that such gravitational instabilities\ncontribute to the formation of the Broad Line Regions (BLRs) in AGNs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Mar 2003 12:36:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

A mean field model, a generalized\nrandom energy model of liquids is developed, which exhibits a dynamical\ntransition of the onset of slow dynamics at T_0, alteration of the nature of\nmotion from the saddle-to-saddle to minimum-to-minimum motion at T_c, and an\nideal glass transition at T_k. If the energy spectrum of the configurations has\na low energy tail, the model also allows a thermodynamic liquid-liquid\ntransition at T_l. The liquid-liquid transition of the model is correlated to\nthe kinetic fragile-strong transition accompanied by the anomalous slowing down\nof motion. Fragility of the system is classified in terms of features of the\nenergy landscape such as ruggedness of the potential energy surface, size of\nthe cooperative motion invoked in a transition from one configuration to\nanother, and energy needed to deform the local structure in the cooperative\nmotion. A simple relation is found between diffusion constant, D and the saddle\nindex of the potential energy surface, f, as $D \\propto f^{a}$, where a depends\non the size of the cooperative motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Mar 2003 01:51:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Specifically, we are interested in what happens when a system\nparameter is slowly swept in time through the bifurcation. Such situations are\nknown to be indeterminate in the sense that it is difficult to predict the\neventual fate of an orbit that tracks the pre-bifurcation node attractor as the\nsystem parameter is swept through the bifurcation. In this paper we investigate\nthe scaling of (1) the fractal basin boundary of the static (i.e., unswept)\nsystem near the saddle-node bifurcation, (2) the dependence of the orbit's\nfinal destination on the sweeping rate, (3) the dependence of the time it takes\nfor an attractor to capture a swept orbit on the sweeping rate, and (4) the\ndependence of the final attractor capture probability on the noise level.
