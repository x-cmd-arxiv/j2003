In general relativity, the equivalence principle tells us the\nexistence of a local inertial coordinate system and the fundamental laws in the\nlocal inertial coordinate system which are the same as those in inertial\nreference system. Then, after a general coordinate transformation, the\nfundamental laws of nature in arbitrary coordinate system or in arbitrary\ncurved space-time can be obtained. However, through a simple example, we find\nthat, under a general coordinate transformation, basic physical equations in\ngeneral relativity do not transform covariantly, especially they do not\npreserve their forms under the transformation from a local inertial coordinate\nsystem to a curved space-time. The origination of the violation of the general\ncovariance is then studied, and a general theory on general coordinate\ntransformations is developed. Because of the the existence of the\nnon-homogeneous term, the fundamental laws of nature in arbitrary curved\nspace-time can not be expressed by space-time metric, physical observable and\ntheir derivatives. In other words, basic physical equations obtained from the\nequivalence principle and the principle of general covariance are different\nfrom those in general relativity. Both the equivalence principle and the\nprinciple of general covariance can not be treated as foundations of general\nrelativity. So, what are the foundations of General Relativity?

The spectral region of this\nradiation defined experimentally occurred to be in the range of 200-290 nm. As\nthe filter cutting off the short wave length part of the spectrum (below 290nm)\n1 mm thick plexiglas has been used, while as the filters transmitting short\nwave part of the spectrum - 5 mkm thick fluorostatic film or 1 mm thick optical\nquartz has been selected. It has been shown, that dynamics of development of\nthe cells in the culture depends on transparency of nutrient medium to\nspontaneous ultraviolet radiation of the cells. Conclusion has been made, that\nsuperweak chemiluminescence of the cells is not a worthless metabolism product,\nbut plays significant biological role.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Mar 2003 17:53:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Apr 2003 20:22:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
