We consider the curves which can be obtained from the\nprojective line by gluing several points together or by taking cusp\nsingularities. (More general cases of gluing subschemas will be considered in\nthe next paper). It appears that on such curves all ingredients of Hitchin\nintegrable system (moduli space of vector bundles, dualizing sheaf, Higgs field\netc.) can be explicitly described, which may deserve independent interest. As a\nmain result we find explicit formulas for the Hitchin hamiltonians. We also\nshow how to obtain the Hitchin integrable system on such a curve as a\nhamiltonian reduction from a more simple system on some finite-dimensional\nspace. In this paper we also work out the case of a degenerate curve of genus\ntwo and find the analogue of the Narasimhan-Ramanan parameterization of\nSL(2)-bundles. We describe the Hitchin system in such coordinates. As a\ndemonstration of the efficiency of our approach we also rederive the rational\nand trigonometric Calogero systems from the Hitchin system on cusp and node\nwith a marked point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Mar 2003 08:15:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Using a source of\ncorrelated photons, we have implemented several methods investigating a wide\nrange of processes, e.g., unitary, decohering, and polarizing. One of these\nmethods, ancilla-assisted process tomography (AAPT), makes use of an additional\n``ancilla system,'' and we have theoretically determined the conditions when\nAAPT is possible. All prior schemes for AAPT make use of entangled states. Our\nresults show that, surprisingly, entanglement is not required for AAPT, and we\npresent process tomography data obtained using an input state that has no\nentanglement. However, the use of entanglement yields superior results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Mar 2003 20:45:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Mar 2003 21:36:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
