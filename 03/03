We show that neither dust depletion nor intervening HII\nregions inside DLAs offer a viable justification to these underabundances. A\nnatural explanation is found in the framework of photoionization models of HI\nregions embedded in an ionizing continuum with varying spectral distribution.\nAt z ~ 2.5 the observed Ar deficiencies are large, [Ar/alpha] ~ -0.6/-0.8 dex,\nsuggestive of a hard, QSO-dominated spectrum. At z >~ 3 the deficiencies are\ninstead small, suggestive of a soft, stellar-type spectrum, though more data\nare needed to generalize this high-z result. We argue that the change of Ar\nabundances is induced by the evolution of the UV metagalactic continuum, in\nwhich case the UV emission internal to DLAs must be small (i.e. DLAs should\nhave modest star formation rates) and the external background must become\nsofter at z > 3. The former requirement is consistent with the modest evolution\nof DLAs abundances and the lack of Ly_alpha and H_alpha emissions associated\nwith DLAs. The latter requirement is consistent with the observed evolution of\nSiIV/CIV ratios in the IGM, the claims of high escape fraction of UV photons\nfrom Ly-break galaxies at z >~ 3, and the recent finding that the HeII\nre-ionization seems to occur between z ~ 3.4 and z ~ 3.

We show that hydrodynamic fluctuations in\nsupersymmetric theories generate essentially the same long-time power-law tails\nin real-time correlation functions that are known in simple fluids.
