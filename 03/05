The\ntorus accretes, however, because of the transport of angular momentum due to\nthe magnetorotational instability (MRI). Initially, accretion is dominated by\nthe polar funnel, as in the hydrodynamic inviscid case, where material has zero\nor very low angular momentum. At the later phase of the evolution, the torus\nthickens towards the poles and develops a corona or an outflow or both.\nConsequently, the mass accretion through the funnel is stopped. The accretion\nof rotating gas through the torus is significantly reduced compared to the\naccretion of non-rotating gas (i.e., the Bondi rate).

A natural question is how many clusters are\nappropriate for the description of a given system. Traditional approaches to\nthis problem are based either on a framework in which clusters of a particular\nshape are assumed as a model of the system or on a two-step procedure in which\na clustering criterion determines the optimal assignments for a given number of\nclusters and a separate criterion measures the goodness of the classification\nto determine the number of clusters. In a statistical mechanics approach,\nclustering can be seen as a trade--off between energy-- and entropy--like\nterms, with lower temperature driving the proliferation of clusters to provide\na more detailed description of the data. For finite data sets, we expect that\nthere is a limit to the meaningful structure that can be resolved and therefore\na minimum temperature beyond which we will capture sampling noise. This\nsuggests that correcting the clustering criterion for the bias which arises due\nto sampling errors will allow us to find a clustering solution at a temperature\nwhich is optimal in the sense that we capture maximal meaningful structure --\nwithout having to define an external criterion for the goodness or stability of\nthe clustering.
