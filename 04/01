One can either interpret this as a\nmanifestation of cosmic variance or as a physical effect that requires an\nexplanation. We discuss various mechanisms that could be responsible for the\nsuppression of such low $\\ell$ multipoles. Features in the late time evolution\nof metric fluctuations may do this via the integral Sachs-Wolfe effect. Another\npossibility is a suppression of power at large scales in the primordial\nspectrum induced by a fast rolling stage in the evolution of the inflaton field\nat the beginning of the last 65 e-folds of inflation. We illustrate this effect\nin a simple model of inflation and fit the resulting CMB spectrum to the\nobserved temperature-temperature (TT) power spectrum. We find that the WMAP\nobservations suggest a cutoff at $k_c=4.9^{+1.3}_{-1.6}\\times\n10^{-4}$Mpc$^{-1}$ at 68% confidence, while only an upper limit of $k_c <\n7.4\\times 10^{-4}$Mpc$^{-1}$ at 95%.

Also, we\nfind that the exchange of the four types of orientifold two-planes in string\ntheory, has a common picture in M-theory. Moreover, we find that the assignment\nof the extra charge is fixed by cohomology and by the flux quantization of the\nfield strength G in M-theory. We conclude that cohomology is sufficient to\ndescribe some orientifold properties in M-theory, that at string theory level,\nonly K-theory is able to explain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Mar 2003 20:11:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Nov 2003 20:41:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
