The location of the transition lines depends on the boundary\nconditions at the two ends of the tubes. Three types of boundary conditions are\nstudied: (A) Periodic boundary conditions which correspond to a closed\ntorus-like tube. (B) Fixed motor densities at the two tube ends where radial\nequilibrium holds locally; and (C) Diffusive motor injection at one end and\ndiffusive motor extraction at the other end. In addition to the phase diagrams,\nwe also determine the profiles for the bound and unbound motor densities using\nmean field approximations and Monte Carlo simulations.

This is possible because of the universal character of free\nfall, and would break down in its absence. On the other hand, the teleparallel\nversion of general relativity is a gauge theory for the translation group and,\nas such, describes the gravitational interaction by a force similar to the\nLorentz force of electromagnetism, a non-universal interaction. Relying on this\nanalogy it is shown that, although the geometric description of general\nrelativity necessarily requires the existence of the equivalence principle, the\nteleparallel gauge approach remains a consistent theory for gravitation in its\nabsence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Apr 2003 18:32:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 31 Aug 2003 13:50:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
