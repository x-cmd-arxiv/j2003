The largest oscillation occurs at about 0.8 degrees, corresponding\nto 2.8 h^{-1} Mpc at the median redshift of our survey, as expected in halo\noccupation distribution descriptions of galaxy clustering.\n  We invert the angular correlation function using Singular Value Decomposition\nto measure the three-dimensional power spectrum and find that it too is in good\nagreement with previous measurements.
