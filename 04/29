Local patches of disk are modeled by\nnumerically integrating the equations of radiation MHD in the flux-limited\ndiffusion approximation. The shearing-box approximation is used, and the\nvertical component of gravity is neglected. Magneto-rotational instability\n(MRI) leads to turbulence in which accretion stresses are due primarily to\nmagnetic torques. When radiation is locked to gas over the length and time\nscales of fluctuations in the turbulence, the accretion stress, density\ncontrast, and dissipation differ little from those in the corresponding\ncalculations with radiation replaced by extra gas pressure. However, when\nradiation diffuses each orbit a distance that is comparable to the RMS vertical\nwavelength of the MRI, radiation pressure is less effective in resisting\nsqueezing. Large density fluctuations occur, and radiation damping of\ncompressive motions converts PdV work into photon energy. The accretion stress\nin calculations having a net vertical magnetic field is found to be independent\nof opacity over the range explored, and approximately proportional to the\nsquare of the net field. In calculations with zero net magnetic flux, the\naccretion stress depends on the portion of the total pressure that is effective\nin resisting compression. The stress is lower when radiation diffuses rapidly\nwith respect to the gas. We show that radiation-supported Shakura-Sunyaev disks\naccreting via internal magnetic stresses are likely in their interiors to have\nradiation marginally coupled to turbulent gas motions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Apr 2003 21:28:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Our\nanalysis reveals conclusively that the softening of the X-ray continuum with\nincreasing flux in MCG -6-30-15 and NGC 3516 is a result of summing two\nspectral components: a soft varying component (SVC) with spectral shape\nindependent of flux and a constant hard component (HCC). In contrast, the\nspectral variability in NGC 4051 can be well described by simple pivoting of\none component, together with an additional hard constant component. The\nspectral variability model for NGC 5506 is ambiguous, due to the smaller range\nof fluxes sampled by the data. We investigate the shape of the hard spectral\ncomponent in MCG -6-30-15 and find that it appears similar to a pure reflection\nspectrum, but requires a large reflected fraction (R>3).

Afterwards,\nthese equations are completed with the standard LO and NLO DGLAP evolution\nterms, in order to obtain the proper behaviour of the parton distributions at\nmoderate and large values of $x$. The equations obtained are applied to the\nfollowing observables and processes: (i) to the nucleon structure function,\n$g_1$, in the polarized deep inelastic scattering, (ii) to the structure\nfunction of the polarized photon, $g_1^{\\gamma}$, in the scattering of a lepton\non a polarized photon, and (iii) to the differential structure function, $x_J\nd^2g_1/dx_J dk_J^2$, in the polarized deep inelastic scattering accompanied by\na forward jet.

We construct for such flows a `renormalization\ndynamics' on an appropriate `moduli space', which generalizes the Teichm\\\"uller\nflow. If a flow is renormalizable and the space of smooth functions is\n`stable', in the sense that the Lie derivative operator on smooth functions has\nclosed range, the behaviour of ergodic integrals can be analyzed, at least in\nprinciple, in terms of an Oseledec's decomposition for a `renormalization\ncocycle' over the bundle of `basic currents' for the orbit foliation of the\nflow. This approach was suggested by the author's proof of the\nKontsevich-Zorich conjectures and it has since been applied, in collaboration\nwith L.
