However by relaxing\nthe hypothesis that the fluctuation spectrum can be described by a single power\nlaw, we demonstrate that an Einstein-de Sitter universe with {\\em zero}\ncosmological constant can fit the data as well as the best concordance model.\nMoreover unlike a $\\Lambda$-dominated universe, such an universe has no strong\nintegrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, so is in better agreement with the low\nquadrupole seen by WMAP. The main problem is that the Hubble constant is\nrequired to be rather low: $H_0 \\simeq 46$ km/s/Mpc; we discuss whether this\ncan be consistent with observations. Furthermore for universes consisting only\nof baryons and cold dark matter, the amplitude of matter fluctuations on\ncluster scales is too high, a problem which seems generic. However, an\nadditional small contribution ($\\Omega_X \\sim 0.1$) of matter which does not\ncluster on small scales, e.g. relic neutrinos with mass of order eV or a\n`quintessence' with $w \\sim 0$, can alleviate this problem.

Significant variations\nhave been observed in the iron feature, with the less prominent ionized line\nseemingly being the only one responsible for them: its variations do not appear\nto correlate with the strength of the continuum. The high energy cutoff and the\nFe feature suggest the presence of an accretion flow in the Centaurus A\nnucleus.

A more plausible configuration might be a hot thick optically\nthin accretion flow surrounded by material with different opacities.\n  Finally, we note that high energy break observed by BeppoSAX and COMPTEL\ncould be also reasonably explained by Inverse Compton radiation from a jet.

We observe large variations of the spectral index\n(from 0.8 to 2.4) in a wide range of temperatures (11 to 80 K). These spectral\nindex variations follow a hyperbolic-shaped function of the temperature, high\nspectral indices (1.6-2.4) being observed in cold regions (11-20 K) while low\nindices (0.8-1.6) are observed in warm regions (35-80 K). Three distinct\neffects may play a role in this temperature dependence: one is that the grain\nsizes change in dense environments, another is that the chemical composition of\nthe grains is not the same in different environments, a third one is that there\nis an intrinsic dependence of the dust spectral index on the temperature due to\nquantum processes. This last effect is backed up by laboratory measurements and\ncould be the dominant one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Apr 2003 15:31:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Recent studies of\nprimordial star formation have shown that, in the absence of metals (elements\nheavier than helium), the formation of stars with masses 100 times that of the\nSun would have been strongly favoured, and that low-mass stars could not have\nformed before a minimum level of metal enrichment had been reached. The value\nof this minimum level is very uncertain, but is likely to be between 10^{-6}\nand 10^{-4} that of the Sun.

The dust\nprovides a pathway for cooling the gas that leads to fragmentation of the\nprecursor molecular cloud into smaller clumps, which become the lower-mass\nstars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Apr 2003 15:44:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

Neither this eternal inflation\nnor the subsequent non-slow-roll modular inflation destabilise the dilaton from\nits precarious minimum due to the low energy scale of the inflation and\nconsequent small back reaction on the dilaton potential. The observed flat CMB\nspectrum is obtained from fluctuations in the angular component of a modulus\nnear a symmetric point, which are hugely magnified by the roll down of the\nmodulus to Planckian values, allowing them to dominate the final curvature\nperturbation.

Various outcomes of the collision\nare identified, the most interesting one being merger of the solitons into a\nsingle zero-velocity pulse, which suggests a way to create pulses of ``standing\nlight\". The merger occurs with the solitons whose energy takes values between\n0.15 and 0.35 of the limit value, while their velocity is limited by about 0.2\nof the limit light velocity in the fiber. If the energy is larger, another\nnoteworthy outcome is acceleration of the solitons as a result of the\ncollision. In the case of mutual passage of the solitons, inelasticity of the\ncollision is quantified by the energy-loss share. Past the soliton's stability\nlimit, the collision results in strong deformation and subsequent destruction\nof the solitons. Simulations of multiple collisions of two solitons in a\nfiber-loop configuration are performed too. In this case, the maximum velocity\nadmitting the merger increases to about 0.4 of the limit velocity. Influence of\nan attractive local defect on the collision is also studied, with a conclusion\nthat the defect does not alter the overall picture, although it traps a\nsmall-amplitude pulse. Related effects in single-soliton dynamics are\nconsidered too, such as transformation of an input sech signal into a gap\nsoliton (which is quantified by the share of lost energy), and the rate of\ndecay of a quiescent gap soliton in a finite fiber grating, due to energy\nleakage through loose edges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Apr 2003 07:12:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
