Classifying these objects by their emission-line ratios,\nwe find that 50% of the objects are robustly classified as LINERs while an\nadditional 25% are likely to be LINERs. Photoionization calculations show that\nthe Spectral Energy Distribution of the well-studied WLRG 3C 270 (NGC 4261) is\nable to produce the observed emission-line ratios, but only if the UV emission\nseen by the narrow emission-line gas is significantly higher than that\nobserved, implying A_V = 2.5-4.2 magnitudes along our line of sight to the\nnucleus. From the photoionization calculations, we find that the emission-line\ngas must have an ionization parameter between 10^-3.5 and 10^-4.0 and a wide\nrange in hydrogen density (10^2-10^6 cm^-3) to reproduce the measured\nemission-line ratios, similar to the properties inferred for the emission-line\ngas in LINERs. Thus, we find that properties of the emission-line gas as well\nas the underlying excitation mechanism are indeed similar in LINERs and WLRGs.\nBy extension, the central engines of accretion-powered LINERs and WLRGs, which\ndo host an accreting black hole, may be qualitatively similar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Apr 2003 21:28:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The walker, making instantaneous\njumps from one site of the lattice to another, resides in each site for\nextended times. The sojourn times have a distribution psi(t) that is assumed to\nbe an inverse power law. We assume that the Onsager principle is fulfilled, and\nwe use this assumption to establish a complete equivalence between GME and the\nMontroll-Weiss CTRW. We prove that this equivalence is confined to the case\nwhen psi(t) is an exponential. We argue that is so because the Montroll-Weiss\nCTRW, as recently proved by Barkai [E. Barkai, Phys. Rev.

We consider the\ncase of a dichotomous fluctuation, and we prove that the Onsager principle is\nfulfilled for any form of regression to equilibrium provided that the\nstationary condition holds true. We set the stationary condition on both the\nCTRW and the GME, thereby creating a condition of total equivalence, regardless\nthe nature of the waiting time distribution. As a consequence of this procedure\nwe create a GME that it is a \"bona fide\" master equation, in spite of being\nnon-Markovian. We note that the memory kernel of the GME affords information on\nthe interaction between system of interest and its bath. The Poisson case\nyields a bath with infinitely fast fluctuations. We argue that departing from\nthe Poisson form has the effect of creating a condition of infinite memory and\nthat these results might be useful to shed light into the problem of how to\nunravel non-Markovian master equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Apr 2003 03:26:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

This result says that for language A\ndecidable in exponential time, either the class of languages reducible to A\n(the lower span) or the class of problems to which A can be reduced (the upper\nspan) is small in the sense of resource-bounded measure and, in particular,\nthat the degree of A is small. Small span theorems have been proven for\nincreasingly stronger polynomial-time reductions, and a small span theorem for\npolynomial-time Turing reductions would imply BPP != EXP. In contrast to the\nprogress in resource-bounded measure, Ambos-Spies, Merkle, Reimann, and Stephan\n(2001) showed that there is no small span theorem for the resource-bounded\ndimension of Lutz (2000), even for polynomial-time many-one reductions.\n  Resource-bounded scaled dimension, recently introduced by Hitchcock, Lutz,\nand Mayordomo (2003), provides rescalings of resource-bounded dimension. We use\nscaled dimension to further understand the contrast between measure and\ndimension regarding polynomial-time spans and degrees. We strengthen prior\nresults by showing that the small span theorem holds for polynomial-time\nmany-one reductions in the -3rd-order scaled dimension, but fails to hold in\nthe -2nd-order scaled dimension. Our results also hold in exponential space.\n  As an application, we show that determining the -2nd- or -1st-order scaled\ndimension in ESPACE of the many-one complete languages for E would yield a\nproof of P = BPP or P != PSPACE. On the other hand, it is shown unconditionally\nthat the complete languages for E have -3rd-order scaled dimension 0 in ESPACE\nand -2nd- and -1st-order scaled dimension 1 in E.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Apr 2003 19:43:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We\naddress two important and related issues that constitute severe obstacles\ntowards model building within this type of constructions: the possibilities of\nachieving satisfactory Yukawa couplings and Higgs potentials. We consider\nmodels where matter fermions are localized at the orbifold fixed-points and\ncouple to additional heavy fermions in the bulk. When integrated out, the\nlatter induce tree-level non-local Yukawa interactions and a quantum\ncontribution to the Higgs potential that we explicitly evaluate and analyse.\nThe general features of these highly constrained models are illustrated through\na minimal but potentially realistic five-dimensional example. Finally, we\ndiscuss possible cures for the persisting difficulties in achieving acceptable\ntop and Higgs masses. In particular, we consider in some detail the effects\ninduced in these models by adding localized kinetic terms for gauge fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Apr 2003 10:35:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Aug 2003 14:17:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
