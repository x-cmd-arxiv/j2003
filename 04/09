This is close to that measured for extremely red objects\n(EROs) associated with a population of old elliptical galaxies at z~1 by Daddi\net al. (2001). Based on their similar clustering properties, we propose that\nEROs and powerful radio galaxies may be the same systems seen at different\nevolutionary stages. Their r_0 is ~2 times higher than that of QSOs at a\nsimilar redshift, and comparable to that of bright ellipticals locally. This\nsuggests that r_0 (comoving) of these galaxies has changed little from z~1 to\nz=0, in agreement with current LCDM hierarchical models for clustering\nevolution of massive early-type galaxies. Alternatively, the clustering of\nradio galaxies can be explained by the galaxy conservation model. This then\nimplies that radio galaxies of average power are the progenitors of the local\nearly-type field population, while the most powerful radio galaxies will evolve\ninto a present-day population with r_0 similar to that of local rich clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Apr 2003 12:42:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

This catastrophe is caused by the vanishing of\nthe elastic shear modulus. We found that this critical volume is independent of\nthe route by which it is reached whether by heating the crystal, or by adding\ninterstitials at a constant temperature which expand the lattice. Overall,\nthese results are similar to what was found previously for an fcc metal,\ncopper. The simulations establish a phase diagram of the mechanical melting\ntemperature as a function of the concentration of interstitials.

If we propagate the particle along some\npath, the parallel transport of the gauge connection acts on this\nrepresentation. The Lagrangian density of the gauge field depends on the\ncurvature of the connection which can be calculated from the holonomy around\n(infinitesimal) loops. For Abelian symmetry groups, say G=U(1), there exists a\ngeneralization, known as p-form electrodynamics, in which (p-1)-dimensional\ncharged objects can be propagated along p-surfaces and in which the Lagrangian\ndepends on a generalized curvature associated with (infinitesimal) closed\np-surfaces. In this article, we use Lie 2-groups and ideas from higher category\ntheory in order to formulate a discrete gauge theory which generalizes these\nmodels at the level p=2 to possibly non-Abelian symmetry groups. An important\nfeature of our model is that it involves both parallel transports along paths\nand generalized transports along surfaces with a non-trivial interplay of these\ntwo types of variables. Our main result is the geometric picture, namely the\nassignment of non-Abelian quantities to geometrical objects in a coordinate\nfree way. We construct the precise assignment of variables to the curves and\nsurfaces, the generalized local symmetries and gauge invariant actions and we\nclarify which structures can be non-Abelian and which others are always\nAbelian. A discrete version of connections on non-Abelian gerbes is a special\ncase of our construction. Even though the motivation sketched so far suggests\napplications mainly in string theory, the model presented here is also related\nto spin foam models of quantum gravity and may in addition provide some insight\ninto the role of centre monopoles and vortices in lattice QCD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Apr 2003 18:39:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Apr 2003 20:02:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
