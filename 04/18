The theory starts by\nrecognizing the essential role played by spin-orbit interactions in determining\nthe energies of ferromagnetic resonances in the collective excitation spectrum\nand the strength of their coupling to low-energy particle-hole excitations. We\nargue that a crossover between Landau-damped ferromagnetic resonance and\npure-state collective magnetic excitations occurs as the number of atoms in\ntypical transition metal ferromagnet nanoparticles drops below approximately\n$10^4$, approximately where the single-particle level spacing, $\\delta$,\nbecomes larger than, $\\sqrt{\\alpha} E_{\\rm res}$, where $E_{\\rm res}$ is the\nferromagnetic resonance frequency and $\\alpha$ is the Gilbert damping\nparameter. We illustrate our ideas by studying the properties of semi-realistic\nmodel Hamiltonians, which we solve numerically for nanoparticles containing\nseveral hundred atoms. For small nanoparticles, we find one isolated\nferromagnetic resonance collective mode below the lowest particle-hole\nexcitation energy, at $E_{\\rm res} \\approx 0.1$ meV. The spectral weight of\nthis pure excitation nearly exhausts the transverse dynamical susceptibility\nspectral weight. As $\\delta$ approaches $\\sqrt{\\alpha} E_{\\rm res}$, the\nferromagnetic collective excitation is more likely to couple strongly with\ndiscrete particle-hole excitations.

This follows\nfrom the fact that the RG equation of the Wilson-Polchinski type which\ndescribes the genus zero sector of non-commutative field theories couples\ngeneric planar amplitudes with non-planar amplitudes at exceptional values of\nthe external momenta. We prove that the renormalization problem can be\nconsistently restricted to this set of amplitudes. In the resulting\nrenormalized theory non-planar divergences are treated as UV divergences\nrequiring appropriate non-local counterterms. In 4 dimensions the model turns\nout to have one more relevant (non-planar) coupling than its commutative\ncounterpart. This non-planar coupling is ``evanescent'': although in the\nmassive (but not in the massless) case its contribution to planar amplitudes\nvanishes when the floating cut-off equals the renormalization scale, this\ncoupling is needed to make the Wilsonian effective action UV finite at all\nvalues of the floating cut-off.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Apr 2003 17:47:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Apr 2003 10:47:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
