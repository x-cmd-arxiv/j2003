We treat galaxies as the building blocks of the Universe, but\nignore most aspects of their internal structures by considering them as point\nsources. However, we do consider general morphological types in order to use\ndata from galaxy redshift surveys, where some kind of morphological\nclassification is adopted. We start with a general relativistic treatment for a\ngeneral spacetime, and then link the derived expressions with the LF definition\nadopted in observational cosmology. Then equations for differential number\ncounts, the related relativistic density per source, and observed and total\nrelativistic energy densities of the universe, and other related quantities are\nwritten in terms of the luminosity and selection functions. As an example of\nhow these theoretical/observational relationships can be used, we apply them to\ntest the LF parameters determined from the CNOC2 galaxy redshift survey, for\nconsistency with the Einstein-de Sitter (EdS) cosmology, which they assume, for\nintermediate redshifts. We conclude that there is a general consistency for the\ntests we carried out, namely both the observed relativistic mass-energy\ndensity, and the observed relativistic mass-energy density per source, which is\nequivalent to differential number counts, in an EdS Universe. In addition, we\nfind clear evidence of a large amount of hidden mass, as has been obvious from\nmany earlier investigations. At the same time, we find that the CNOC2 LF give\ndifferential galaxy counts somewhat above the EdS predictions, indicating that\nthis survey observes more galaxies at 0.1 < z < 0.4 than the model's\npredictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Apr 2003 18:28:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We present a combinatorial game, the\n``root game'', which provides some criteria for determining which of the\nSchubert intersection numbers vanish. The definition of the root game is\nmanifestly invariant under automorphisms of G, and under permutations of the\nclasses intersected. Although these criteria are not proven to cover all cases,\nin practice they work very well, giving a complete answer to the question for\nG=SL(7,C). In a separate paper we show that one of these criteria is in fact\nnecessary and sufficient when the classes are pulled back from a Grassmannian.\n  More generally If G' -> G is an inclusion of complex reductive connected Lie\ngroups, there is an induced map H^*(G/B) -> H^*(G'/B') on the cohomology of the\nhomogeneous spaces. The image of a Schubert class under this map is a positive\nsum of Schubert classes on G'/B'. We investigate the problem of determining\nwhich Schubert classes appear with non-zero coefficient. This is the vanishing\nproblem for branching Schubert calculus, which plays an important role in\nrepresentation theory and symplectic geometry, as shown in [Berenstein-Sjamaar\n2000]. The root game generalises to give a vanishing criterion and a\nnon-vanishing criterion for this problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Apr 2003 00:43:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Aug 2003 23:02:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2005 05:04:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2006 19:57:18 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2007 18:28:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
