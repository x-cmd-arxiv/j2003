The point source\nflux from a PBH in its final stages of emission will in mSUGRA benchmark models\nboth quantitatively and qualitatively differ from that in the Standard Model.\nThe dominant part of the diffuse gamma-ray flux should not be affected by any\nsupersymmetric particles. However, for PBHs with initial mass approximately in\nthe range [4x10^13 g, 1x10^14 g], the diffuse Standard Model flux at photon\nenergies E_0 > ~1 GeV will generally be less than roughly 50% greater than for\nmSUGRA benchmark models.

This is achieved\nby explicit factorizations of $A_{n}(\\{q_{kl}\\})$ as a product of matrices of\nthe form $(1-QT)^{\\pm 1}$, where Q is a diagonal matrix and T is a regular\nrepresen- tation of a cyclic matrix. From such factorizations we obtain in Th.\n1.9.2 explicit formulas for the determinant of $A_{n}(\\{q_{kl}\\})$ in the\ngeneric case (which generalizes Zagier's 1-parametric formula). For inversion\nof $A_{n} (\\{q_{kl}\\})$ we use ideas of Bo\\v{z}ejko and Speicher, and Th.2.2.6\ngives a definite answer in terms of maximal chains in subdivision lattices. Our\nalgorithm in Proposition 2.2.18 for computing the entries of $A_{n}(\\{q_{kl}\\}\n)$ is very efficient. In particular for $n=8$, when all $q_{kl}=q$, we found a\ncounterexample to Zagier's conjecture concerning the form of the denominators\nof the entries in the inverse of $A_{n}(q)$. In Cor.2.2.8 we extend Zagier's\nConjecture to multiparameter case. By applying a faster algorithm in\nProp.2.2.19 we obtain in Th.2.2.20 explicit formulas for the inverse of the\nmatrices $A_n(\\{q_{kl}\\})$ in the generic case. There are applications of these\nresults to discriminant arrangements of hyperplanes and to contravariant forms\nof certain quantum groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Apr 2003 17:18:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
