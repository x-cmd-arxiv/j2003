Widely accepted explanations do not exist for this variability\nor for the mechanism producing the radiation. The variability corresponds to\nthe field statistics, particularly the distribution of wave field amplitudes,\nwhich are predicted by theories for wave growth in inhomogeneous media. This\npaper shows that the field statistics of the Vela pulsar (PSR B0833-45) are\nwell-defined and vary as a function of pulse phase, evolving from Gaussian\nintensity statistics off-pulse to approximately power-law and then lognormal\ndistributions near the pulse peak to approximately power-law and eventually\nGaussian statistics off-pulse again. Detailed single-component fits confirm\nthat the variability corresponds to lognormal statistics near the peak of the\npulse profile and Gaussian intensity statistics off-pulse. The lognormal field\nstatistics observed are consistent with the prediction of stochastic growth\ntheory (SGT) for a purely linear system close to marginal stability. The\nsimplest interpretations are that the pulsar's variability is a direct\nmanifestation of an SGT state and the emission mechanism is linear (either\ndirect or indirect), with no evidence for nonlinear mechanisms like\nmodulational instability and wave collapse which produce power-law field\nstatistics. Stringent constraints are placed on nonlinear mechanisms: they must\nproduce lognormal statistics when suitably ensemble-averaged. Field statistics\nare thus a powerful, potentially widely applicable tool for understanding\nvariability and constraining mechanisms and source characteristics of coherent\nastrophysical and space emissions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Apr 2003 01:10:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Moreover, they can be computed quickly, which is a great advantage when\nfitting observations using automated procedures. In this paper we wish to\nassess the accuracy and reliability of 2-layer models, by comparing them to\ndetailed vertical structure models with accurate 1+1D radiative transfer. We\nfocus on the shape of the SED, and the predicted height and \"flaring index\" of\nthe disk. We first consider models where scattering is set to zero. We find\nthat 2-layer models overestimate significantly the near-infrared flux, and we\nsuggest a simple way of correcting this effect, at least in part. At longer\nwavelengths, the SED of two-layer models often show a two-bump structure, which\nis absent in 1+1D models. Nevertheless, overall agreement is reasonably good,\nand the differences are in most cases within 30%. At (sub)-mm wavelengths the\ndifferences may even be less. The shape of the disk, as measured by its\npressure and surface scale height and by the flaring angle are also well\nreproduced by two-layer models. When scattering is included in the 1+1D models,\nthe differences become larger, especially in the near-infrared.

The HERA-B trigger is a\nmessage-driven multi-level track trigger. The first level trigger (FLT)\nconsists of custom-made electronics, and the higher trigger levels are\nimplemented as PC farms.\n  The multiplicity veto has been designed to reject high-multiplicity events\nbefore they enter the trigger chain. A veto signal is generated based on the\ncomparison of the number of photons in part of the HERA-B ring-imaging\nCherenkov counter (RICH) with a programmable threshold.\n  The RICH Multiplicity Veto is a modular system. First the hits in 256\ndetector channels are summed by Base Sum Cards (BSC), then FED Sum Cards (FSC)\nsum the subtotals of up to eight BSCs. Finally the Veto Board (VB) takes the\nveto decision based on the sum of up to 14 FSCs.\n  The RICH Multiplicity Veto has been successfully installed and commissioned\nin HERA-B. The measured veto efficiency is (99.9991+/-0.0001)%, and the system\nis used in the routine data-taking of the HERA-B experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Apr 2003 05:55:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It has only been exactly solved\nfor the special case of dimer coverings in two dimensions. In earlier work,\nStanley proved a reciprocity principle governing the number $N(m,n)$ of dimer\ncoverings of an $m$ by $n$ rectangular grid (also known as perfect matchings),\nwhere $m$ is fixed and $n$ is allowed to vary. As reinterpreted by Propp,\nStanley's result concerns the unique way of extending $N(m,n)$ to $n < 0$ so\nthat the resulting bi-infinite sequence, $N(m,n)$ for $n \\in {Z}$, satisfies a\nlinear recurrence relation with constant coefficients. In particular, Stanley\nshows that $N(m,n)$ is always an integer satisfying the relation $N(m,-2-n) =\n\\epsilon_{m,n}N(m,n)$ where $\\epsilon_{m,n} = 1$ unless $m\\equiv$ 2(mod 4) and\n$n$ is odd, in which case $\\epsilon_{m,n} = -1$. Furthermore, Propp's method is\napplicable to higher-dimensional cases. This paper discusses similar\ninvestigations of the numbers $M(m,n)$, of monomer-dimer coverings, or\nequivalently (not necessarily perfect) matchings of an $m$ by $n$ rectangular\ngrid.

We\nshow that $M(m,n)$, a priori a rational number, is always an integer, using a\ngeneralization of the combinatorial model offered by Propp. Lastly, we give a\nnew statement of reciprocity in terms of multivariate generating functions from\nwhich Stanley's result follows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Apr 2003 18:18:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 May 2003 19:20:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It was recognized long ago (at least on a phenomenological level) that\nsystems exhibiting several phases in equilibrium can be described with an\nappropriate variational principle: the phases arrange themselves in such a way\nthat the energy associated with the phase boundaries is minimal. Typically this\nleads to an almost deterministic behavior and the phase boundaries are fairly\nregular. However, when looked at from a microscopic point of view, the system\nconsists of a bunch of erratically moving molecules with relatively strong\nshort-range interaction and the simplicity of the above macroscopic description\nlooks more than miraculous. Indeed, when starting from the molecular level,\nthere are many more questions to be asked and understood: which are the phases\nwhich we will see? why do only those occur? why are the phase boundaries sharp?\nhow should we find (define) the energy associated with the interfaces?

The simplicity\nof the shell model allows us to offer a transparent explanation of the main\nobservations. It is shown that the mechanism for drag reduction operates mainly\non the large scales. Understanding the mechanism allows us to predict how the\namount of drag reduction depends of the various parameters in the model.
