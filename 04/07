In particular, we\ndiscuss the Pruefer transformation, where the original (frequency domain)\nTeukolsky wave equation is replaced by a pair of first-order non-linear\nequations governing the introduced phase functions. Numerical integration of\nthese equations, performed along the real coordinate axis, or along rotated\ncontours in the complex coordinate plane, provides the required S-matrix\nelement (the ratio of amplitudes of the outgoing and ingoing waves at\ninfinity). Mueller's algorithm is then employed to conduct searches in the\ncomplex plane for the poles of this quantity (which are, by definition, the\ndesired resonances). We have tested this method by verifying known results for\nSchwarzschild quasinormal modes and Regge poles, and provide new results for\nthe Kerr black hole problem. We also describe a new method for estimating the\n\"excitation coefficients\" for quasinormal modes. The method is applied to\nscalar waves moving in the Kerr geometry, and the obtained results shed light\non the long-lived quasinormal modes that exist for black holes rotating near\nthe extreme Kerr limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Apr 2003 09:49:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

It is shown that a\nparameter-set called M3Y-P2 describes various properties similarly well to the\nSkyrme SLy5 and/or the Gogny D1S interactions. A remarkable difference from the\nSLy5 and the D1S interactions is found in the spin-isospin properties in the\nnuclear matter, to which the one-pion-exchange potential gives a significant\ncontribution. Affecting the single-particle energies, this difference may play\na certain role in the new magic numbers in unstable nuclei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Apr 2003 10:29:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 May 2003 09:49:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
