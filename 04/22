Around the same time, Harer proved\nthat the homology of the mapping class groups of oriented surfaces is\nindependent of the genus in low degrees, increasing with the genus. The\n(co)homology of mapping class groups thus stabelizes. At least rationally, the\nmapping class groups have the same (co)homology as the corresponding moduli\nspaces. This prompted Mumford to conjecture that the stable rational cohomology\nof moduli spaces is generated by certain tautological classes that he defines.\nMuch of the recent interest in this subject is motivated by mathematical\nphysics and, in particular, by string theory. The study of the category of\nstrings led to the discovery of an infinite loop space, the cohomology of which\nis the stable cohomology of the mapping class groups. We explain here a\nhomotopy theoretic approach to Mumford's conjecture based on this fact. As\nbyproducts infinite families of torsion classes in the stable cohomology are\ndetected, and the divisibility of the tautological classes is determined.

The purpose of this\npaper is to describe some non-deterministic methods, called Genetic Algorithms,\ndesigned to test the validity of the Andrews-Curtis conjecture. Using such\nalgorithm we have been able to prove that all known (to us) balanced\npresentations of the trivial group where the total length of the relators is at\nmost 12 satisfy the conjecture. In particular, the Andrews-Curtis conjecture\nholds for the presentation <x,y|x y x = y x y, x^2 = y^3> which was one of the\nwell known potential counterexamples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Apr 2003 21:07:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The prerequisites for any type of\nquantum formalism or quantum field theory is to investigate whether the\nanatomical structure of brain permits any kind of smooth geometric notion like\nHilbert structure or four dimensional Minkowskian structure for quantum field\ntheory. The present understanding of brain function clearly denies any kind of\nspace-time representation in Minkowskian sense. However, three dimensional\nspace and one time can be assigned to the neuromanifold and the concept of\nprobabilistic geometry is shown to be appropriate framework to understand the\nbrain dynamics. The possibility of quantum structure is also discussed in this\nframework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Apr 2003 20:34:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 May 2003 20:58:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

When the latter is a complex-analytic\nmanifold admitting just one complex structure, there is a unique quantisation\nwhose classical limit is C. Then the notion of coherence is the same for all\nobservers. However, when C admits two or more nonbiholomorphic complex\nstructures, there is one different quantisation per different complex structure\non C. The lack of analyticity in transforming between nonbiholomorphic complex\nstructures can be interpreted as the loss of quantum-mechanical coherence under\nthe corresponding transformation. Observers using one complex structure\nperceive as coherent the states that other observers, using a different complex\nstructure, do not perceive as such. This is the notion of a quantum-mechanical\nduality transformation: the relativity of the notion of a quantum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Apr 2003 12:19:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
