If the wave action is initially compactly\nsupported in frequency space, it is then redistributed by resonant interactions\nproducing the usual direct and inverse cascades, leading to the formation of\nthe K-Z spectra. The emphasis here is on the direct cascade. The evolution\nproceeds by the formation of a self-similar front which propagates to the right\nleaving a quasi-stationary state in its wake. This front is sharp in the sense\nthat the solution remains compactly supported until it reaches infinity. If the\nenergy spectrum has infinite capacity, the front takes infinite time to reach\ninfinite frequency and leaves the K-Z spectrum in its wake. On the other hand,\nif the energy spectrum has finite capacity, the front reaches infinity within a\nfinite time, t*, and the wake is steeper than the K-Z spectrum. For this case,\nthe K-Z spectrum is set up from the right after the front reaches infinity. The\nslope of the solution in the wake can be related to the speed of propagation of\nthe front. It is shown that the anomalous slope in the finite capacity case\ncorresponds to the unique front speed which ensures that the front tip contains\na finite amount of energy as the connection to infinity is made. We also\nintroduce, for the first time, the notion of entropy production in wave\nturbulence and show how it evolves as the system approaches the stationary K-Z\nspectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Apr 2003 07:01:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

It is found that for incompletely self-similar\nsystems dominated by three wave interactions, the weak turbulence approximation\nusually cannot break down at small scales. It follows that such systems cannot\nexhibit small scale intermittency. For systems dominated by four wave\ninteractions, the incomplete self-similarity property implies that the scaling\nof the interaction coefficient depends only on the physical dimension of the\nsystem.

If $F$ is one-to-one and the size of its domain and range is the same,\nthen our problem can be formulated as follows: Given an oracle $f(a,x):\n\\{0,1\\}^n\\times\\{0,1\\}^n \\to \\{0,1\\}$ and a fixed (but hidden) value $a_0$, we\nwish to obtain the value of $a_0$ by querying the oracle $f(a_0,x)$. Our goal\nis to minimize the number of such oracle calls (the query complexity) using a\nquantum mechanism.\n  Two popular oracles are the EQ-oracle defined as $f(a,x)=1$ iff $x=a$ and the\nIP-oracle defined as $f(a,x)= a\\cdot x \\mod 2$. It is also well-known that the\nquery complexity is $\\Theta(\\sqrt{N})$ ($N=2^n$) for the EQ-oracle while only\nO(1) for the IP-oracle. The main purpose of this paper is to fill this gap or\nto investigate what causes this large difference. To do so, we introduce a\nparameter $K$ as the maximum number of 1's in a single column of $T_f$ where\n$T_f$ is the $N\\times N$ truth-table of the oracle $f(a,x)$. Our main result\nshows that the (quantum) query complexity is heavily governed by this parameter\n$K$: ($i$) The query complexity is $\\Omega(\\sqrt{N/K})$. ($ii$) This lower\nbound is tight in the sense that we can construct an explicit oracle whose\nquery complexity is $O(\\sqrt{N/K})$. ($iii$) The tight complexity,\n$\\Theta(\\frac{N}{K}+\\log{K})$, is also obtained for the classical case. Thus,\nthe quantum algorithm needs a quadratically less number of oracle calls when\n$K$ is small and this merit becomes larger when $K$ is large, e.g., $\\log{K}$\nv.s. constant when $K = cN$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Apr 2003 06:48:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
