By monitoring the source at low luminosities over\nseveral months, we found 6 bright ~100 second X-ray flares and long time scale\noscillations of the X-ray flux. The oscillations are aperiodic with a\ncharacteristic time scale of 14.2 days and an order of magnitude variation in\nthe 2.8-20 keV flux. The oscillations may be related to optical\n\"mini-outbursts\" that have been observed at the ends of outbursts for other\nshort orbital period BHC transients. The X-ray flares have durations between 62\nand 215 seconds and peak fluxes that are 5-24 times higher than the persistent\nflux. The flares have non-thermal energy spectra and occur when the persistent\nluminosity is near 3E34 (d/4 kpc)^2 erg/s (2.8-20 keV). The rise time for the\nbrightest flare demonstrates that physical models for BHC systems must be able\nto account for the situation where the X-ray flux increases by a factor of up\nto 24 on a time scale of seconds. We discuss the flares in the context of\nobservations and theory of Galactic BHCs and compare the flares to those\ndetected from Sgr A*, the super-massive black hole at the Galactic center. We\nalso compare the flares to X-ray bursts that are seen in neutron star systems.\nWhile some of the flare light curves are similar to those of neutron star\nbursts, the flares have non-thermal energy spectra in contrast to the blackbody\nspectra exhibited in bursts. This indicates that X-ray bursts should not be\ntaken as evidence that a given system contains a neutron star unless the\npresence of a blackbody component in the burst spectrum can be demonstrated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Apr 2003 16:46:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

For the case when the zero background is\nstable, we elaborate an analytical approximation for solitary-pulse (SP)\nstates. The analytical results are found to be in good agreement with numerical\nfindings. Unlike the driven NLS equation, in the present model SPs feature a\nnontrivial phase structure. Combining the analytical and numerical methods, we\nidentify a stability region for the SP solutions in the model's parameter\nspace. Generally, the increase of the diffusion and nonlinear-loss parameters,\nwhich differ the present model from its driven-NLS counterpart, lead to\nshrinkage of the stability domain. At one border of the stability region, the\nSP is destabilized by the Hopf bifurcation, which converts it into a localized\nbreather. Subsequent period doublings make internal vibrations of the breather\nchaotic. In the case when the zero background is unstable, hence SPs are\nirrelevant, we construct stationary periodic solutions, for which a very\naccurate analytical approximation is developed too. Stability of the periodic\nwaves is tested by direct simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Apr 2003 06:53:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
