However, as the surface magnetic field weakens, the\naccretion takes place over a wider region around the pole, making the flow more\nradial and isotropic. In the present work, we extend this two-dimensional model\nto include the time-dependence of the flow of the accreted material. The final\nradial flow is found to be less efficient in screening the magnetic field\ncompared to the initial tangential flow.

Assuming the initial extent of the polar\ncap to be $\\sim 5^0$--$10^0$, a simple geometric argument suggests that the\nmagnetic field should decay by 3-4 orders of magnitude before stabilizing to an\nasymptotic value, consistent with the magnetic fields observed in millisecond\npulsars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Apr 2003 09:13:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

At\nL_pers=2E37 erg/s the burst rate drops by a factor of five. This corresponds to\nthe transition from, on average, a hydrogen-rich to a pure helium environment\nin which the flashes originate that are responsible for the bursts. At higher\nluminosities the bursts recur irregularly; no bursts are observed at the\nhighest luminosities. Our central finding is that most of the trends in\nbursting behavior are driven by the onset of stable hydrogen burning in the\nneutron star atmosphere. Furthermore, we notice three new observational fact\nwhich are difficult to explain with current burst theory: the presence of short\npure-helium bursts at the lowest accretion regimes, the bimodal distribution of\npeak burst rates, and an accretion rate that is ten times higher than predicted\nat which the onset of stable hydrogen burning occurs. Finally, we note that our\ninvestigation is the first to signal quasi-periodic burst recurrence in KS\n1731-260, and a clear proportionality between the frequency of the\nquasi-periodicity and the persistent flux in GS 1826-24 and KS 1731-260.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Apr 2003 13:07:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

With increasing doping $|n-2|$, the\nferromagnetic transition temperature rapidly decreases and finally becomes zero\nat a critical value of $n$. The second-order phase transition occurs at high\ntemperature, while a phase separation of ferromagnetic and paramagnetic states\ntakes place at low temperature. The superconducting transition temperature\ngradually decreases and finally becomes zero near $n=1$ ($n=3$) where the\nsystem is Mott insulator which shows antiferromagnetism at low temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Apr 2003 11:36:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It is well known that the investigation of non-adiabatic\ngeometric phases ought to be performed only in the Schr\\\"{o}dinger picture. So,\nthe projections of photon spin operators onto the fixed frame of reference is\ndiscussed in this paper. In addition, we also treat the non-normal-order spin\noperators and consider the potential effects (e.g., quantum-vacuum geometric\nphases) of quantum fluctuation fields arising in a curved optical fibre. The\nquantum-vacuum geometric phase, which is of physical interest, can be deducted\nby using the operator normal product, and the doubt of validity and\nuniversality for the normal-normal procedure applied to time-dependent quantum\nsystems is thus proposed. In the Appendix, the discussion of possible\nexperimental realizations of quantum-vacuum geometric phases is briefly\npresented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Apr 2003 05:22:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Apr 2003 07:20:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 28 May 2003 07:48:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We show that\nthe amount of violation of a Bell inequality imposes a lower bound on the\naverage communication needed to produce these correlations. Moreover, for every\nprobability distribution there exists an optimal inequality for which the\ndegree of violation gives the minimal average communication. As an example, to\nproduce using classical resources the correlations that maximally violate the\nCHSH inequality, 0.4142 bits of communication are necessary and sufficient. For\nBell tests performed on two entangled states of dimension d>=3 where each party\nhas the choice between two measurements, our results suggest that more\ncommunication is needed to simulate outcomes obtained from certain\nnon-maximally entangled states than maximally entangled ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Apr 2003 12:06:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-10-22"}
