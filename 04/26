We compare our results obtained by exact diagonalization and\nmean-field theory with the Bethe ansatz, bosonization and other numerical\nstudies in the case of the anisotropic Heisenberg model both in the gapless and\ngapped regime. In particular, we find indications that the Drude weight for\nspin transport is finite in the thermodynamic limit for the isotropic chain.\nFor the non-integrable models, a finite-size analysis of the numerical data for\nthe Drude weights is presented covering the entire parameter space of the\ndimerized and frustrated chain. We also discuss which conclusions can be drawn\nfrom bosonization regarding the question whether the Drude weights are finite\nor not. One of our main results is that the Drude weights vanish in the\nthermodynamic limit for non-integrable models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Apr 2003 17:33:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Oct 2003 14:22:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2020 16:49:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-31"}
