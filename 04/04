Estimates of the binary\nconfusion noise suffer from several sources of astrophysical uncertainty, such\nas the form of the initial mass function and the star formation rate. There is\nalso considerable uncertainty about what defines the confusion limit. Various\nad-hoc rules have been proposed, such as the one source per bin rule, and the\none source per three bin rule. Here information theoretic methods are used to\nderive a more realistic estimate for the confusion limit. It is found that the\ngravitational wave background becomes unresolvable when there is, on average,\nmore than one source per eight frequency bins. This raises the best estimate\nfor the frequency at which galactic binaries become a source of noise from 1.45\nmHz to 2.54 mHz.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Apr 2003 06:40:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
