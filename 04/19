We show that\nthe model reproduces several well known phenomenological and theoretical\naspects of low-energy hadron dynamics. We derive the general formulas for the\nmass spectrum, the decay constants of the pion and vector mesons, and the\ncouplings between mesons. We then consider two simple realizations, one with a\nflat metric and another with a \"cosh\" metric interpolating between two AdS\nboundaries. For the pion form-factor, the single pole rho-meson dominance is\nexact in the latter case and approximate in the former case. We discover that\nan AdS/CFT-like prescription emerges in the computation of current-current\ncorrelators. We speculate on the role of the model in the theory dual to QCD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Apr 2003 19:04:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 14 Feb 2004 07:23:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

There\nare quite a few relevant results for surfaces in the sphere satisfying various\nkinds of curvature equations, including totally umbillic surfaces, minimal\nsurfaces and constant mean curvature surfaces, and intrinsically flat surfaces.\nParabolic flows can strengthen such results by allowing classes of surfaces\nsatisfying curvature inequalities rather than equalities: This was first done\nby Huisken, who used mean curvature flow to deform certain classes of surfaces\nto totally umbillic surfaces. This motivates the question ``What is the optimal\nresult of this kind?'' -- that is, what is the weakest pointwise curvature\ncondition which defines a class of surfaces which retracts to the space of\ngreat spheres? The answer to this question can be guessed in view of the\nexamples.

Penrose made a physical argument that the\ntotal mass of a spacetime which contains black holes with event horizons of\ntotal area $A$ should be at least $\\sqrt{A/16\\pi}$. An important special case\nof this physical statement translates into a very beautiful mathematical\ninequality in Riemannian geometry known as the Riemannian Penrose inequality.\nOne particularly geometric aspect of this problem is the fact that apparent\nhorizons of black holes in this setting correspond to minimal surfaces in\nRiemannian 3-manifolds. The Riemannian Penrose inequality was first proved by\nG. Huisken and T. Ilmanen in 1997 for a single black hole \\cite{HI} and then by\nthe author in 1999 for any number of black holes \\cite{Bray}. The two\napproaches use two different geometric flow techniques. The most general\nversion of the Penrose inequality is still open. In this talk we will sketch\nthe author's proof by flowing Riemannian manifolds inside the class of\nasymptotically flat 3-manifolds (asymptotic to $\\real^3$ at infinity) which\nhave nonnegative scalar curvature and contain minimal spheres. This new flow of\nmetrics has very special properties and simulates an initial physical situation\nin which all of the matter falls into the black holes which merge into a\nsingle, spherically symmetric black hole given by the Schwarzschild metric.\nSince the Schwarzschild metric gives equality in the Penrose inequality and the\nflow decreases the total mass while preserving the area of the horizons of the\nblack holes, the Penrose inequality follows.

We\nfocus on the perturbation expansion of the self energy of non-S states, and\nprovide estimates of the so-called A60 perturbative coefficient, which can be\nconsidered as a relativistic Bethe logarithm. Precise values of A60 are given\nfor many P, D, F and G states, while estimates are given for other electronic\nstates. These results can be used in high-precision spectroscopy experiments in\nhydrogen and hydrogenlike ions. They yield the best available estimate of the\nself-energy correction of many atomic states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Apr 2003 21:42:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Jun 2003 20:12:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This is shown to be equal to the capacity of\nthe channel for generating a secret key, and neither capacity is enhanced by\nforward public classical communication.

The latter implies a new proof of the quantum channel\ncoding theorem and a simple proof of the converse.
