We use a\nsemi-analytic model for reionization (Chiu and Ostriker 2000) that takes into\naccount a number of important physical processes both within collapsing halos\nand in the intergalactic medium. Assuming that the efficiency of producing UV\nphotons per baryon is constant, we derive a constraint of the form sigma_8\nOmega_0^0.5~0.33 in a flat, Lambda-dominated universe with h=0.72, n=0.99, and\nOmega_b h^2=0.024. However, the calculated optical depth to electron scattering\nof tau_es~0.06 is well below the value found by WMAP of 0.17+/-(0.04~0.07)\n(Spergel et al 2003). Since the WMAP constraints on tau_es are somewhat\ndegenerate with the value of the spectral index n, we then permit the\nprimordial spectral index n to float and fix Omega_0 h^2=0.14, while\nnormalizing the power spectrum using WMAP. In addition, we allow the\nUV-efficiency to have time-dependence. Combining the WMAP constraints with the\nquasar transmission data, our analysis then favors a model with\ntau_es=0.11^{+0.02}_{-0.03}, n=0.96^{+0.02}_{-0.03}$, implying\nsigma_8=0.83^{+0.03}_{-0.05} (95% confidence), and an effective UV-efficiency\nthat was at least ~10x greater at z >> 6.

If future observations confirm an\noptical depth to electron scattering tau_es~0.1, then it would appear that no\nmore \"exotic\" sources of UV-photons, such as mini-quasars or AGNs, are\nnecessary; but our analysis indicates that a determination of tau_es>~0.17\nwould require a more radical solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Apr 2003 18:07:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

At a critical separation, a \"trap-induced shape resonance\" between a\nmolecular bound states and a vibrational eigenstate of the trap can occur. This\nresonance leads to an avoided crossing in the eigenspectrum as a function of\nseparation. We investigate how this new resonance can be employed for quantum\ncontrol.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Apr 2003 19:17:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Oct 2003 23:49:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Einstein\nintroduced the Lorentz-covariant world with E = mc^{2}. Feynman observed that\nfast-moving hadrons consist of partons which act incoherently with external\nsignals. If quarks and partons are the same entities observed in different\nLorentz frames, the question then is why partons are incoherent while quarks\nare coherent. This is the most puzzling question Feynman left for us to solve.\nIn this report, we discuss Wigner's role in settling this question. Einstein's\nE = mc^{2}, which takes the form E = \\sqrt{m^{2} + p^{2}}, unifies the\nenergy-momentum relations for massive and massless particles, but it does not\ntake into account internal space-time structure of relativistic particles. It\nis pointed out Wigner's 1939 paper on the inhomogeneous Lorentz group defines\nparticle spin and gauge degrees of freedom in the Lorentz-covariant world.\nWithin the Wigner framework, it is shown possible to construct the internal\nspace-time structure for hadrons in the quark model. It is then shown that the\nquark model and the parton model are two different manifestations of the same\ncovariant entity. It is shown therefore that the lack of coherence in Feynman's\nparton picture is an effect of the Lorentz covariance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Apr 2003 15:37:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Jun 2003 02:05:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
