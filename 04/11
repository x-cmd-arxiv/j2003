In particular, the quadrupole C_2 is reported to have a smaller\nvalue than allowed by cosmic variance. This has been interpreted as a possible\nindication of new physics.

However,\nas is observed in the solar corona, illumination by energetic particles may\nalso produce line emission. In principle, such a process may be uncorrelated\nwith the observed X-rays and could explain some of the unexpected variability\nbehavior of the Fe line. This paper compares predictions of iron K flux\ngenerated by impacting electrons and protons to that from photoionization.\nNon-thermal power-laws of electrons are considered as well as thermal\ndistributions of electrons and virialized protons. The electrons are thought to\noriginate in a magnetically dominated accretion disk corona, while the protons\nare considered in the context of a two phase (hot/cold) accretion scenario. In\neach case, the Fe K flux from particle impact is found to be < 1% of that\nproduced by photoionization by a hard X-ray power-law (normalized to the same\nenergy flux as the particles).

This situation is difficult to\nreconcile with the observations of hard X-ray spectra, or the proposed particle\nacceleration mechanisms in the accretion disk corona. Truncated accretion flows\nmust be externally illuminated by hard X-rays in order to produce the Fe line,\nas proton impact is very inefficient in generating line emission.

In particular, structural relaxation is\nnearly exponential in time at each wave vector, indicating that the mode\ncoupling effects dominating liquid relaxation are comparatively weak within\nthis model. Relaxation properties of the model are instead well reproduced by\nthe simplest dynamical extension of a static Hartree approximation.

We here analyze both data sets, taken\ntogether, to test the hypothesis that the above periodicities, and a related\nperiodicity with a period of about 77 days, are due to r-mode oscillations with\nspherical harmonic indices l = 3 and m = 1, 2, and 3.

We first form a statistic that combines\ninformation from power spectra formed from Homestake and GALLEX-GNO data. From\nthis statistic, we form another statistic to search for a sidereal rotation\nfrequency that leads simultaneously to four peaks in the Homestake-GALLEX-GNO\nspectrum: one corresponding to the synodic rotation frequency nuR - 1, and the\nother three corresponding to the l = 3 r-modes. We find that, in the range 0 to\n20 cycles per year, there is one notable peak at 13.88 cycles per year; This\nfalls in the rotation frequency range of the radiative zone. The corresponding\nsynodic rotation period is 28.4 days, and the corresponding r-mode periods are\n157, 78, and 52 days. By applying the shuffle test to the data, we find that\nthe probability of obtaining by chance a peak this big or bigger in the\nrotation-frequency band of the radiative-zone is less than 0.1%. The modulation\nof the neutrino flux is attributed to the poloidal motion of a magnetic\nstructure that moves in and out of the narrow beam of neutrinos that originate\nin the solar core and are detected on Earth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Apr 2003 21:59:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Free\nquantum field theory on the horizon enjoys diffeomorphism invariance and turns\nout to be unitarily and algebraically equivalent to the analogous theory of a\nscalar field propagating inside Rindler spacetime, nomatter the value of the\nmass of the field in the bulk. More precisely, there exists a unitary\ntransformation that realizes the bulk-boundary correspondence under an\nappropriate choice for Fock representation spaces. Secondly, the found\ncorrespondence is a subcase of an analogous algebraic correspondence described\nby injective *-homomorphisms of the abstract algebras of observables generated\nby abstract quantum free-field operators. These field operators are smeared\nwith suitable test functions in the bulk and exact 1-forms on the horizon. In\nthis sense the correspondence is independent from the chosen vacua. It is\nproven that, under that correspondence the ``hidden'' $SL(2,\\bR)$ quantum\nsymmetry found in a previous work gets a clear geometric meaning, it being\nassociated with a group of diffeomorphisms of the horizon itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Apr 2003 14:13:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Apr 2003 15:23:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 16 Sep 2003 09:44:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

In agreement with theory, we find that\nthis pattern has the maximum conceivable roughness, i.e., its fractal dimension\nis 3.01 plus\\minus 0.04. This insight in the nature of unstable cavity\neigenmodes may lead to better understanding of wave dynamics in open systems,\nfor both light and matter waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Apr 2003 09:29:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

However, in the weak localization regime, both the\nfundamental and vortex solitons spread over many lattice sites.
