We present a robust estimate for the integrated UV luminosity generation\nby AGN as a function of redshift. We find that the LF continues to rise even at\nthe lowest luminosities probed by our survey, but that the slope is\nsufficiently shallow that the contribution of low-luminosity AGN to the UV\nluminosity density is negligible. Although our sample reaches much fainter flux\nlevels than previous data sets, our results on space densities and LF slopes\nare completely consistent with extrapolations from recent major surveys such as\nSDSS and 2QZ.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Apr 2003 11:40:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Jun 2003 13:58:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-06"}

An overview over the ensuing universality classes in single-species\nprocesses is given, and generalizations to reactions with multiple particle\nspecies are discussed as well. The generic case is represented by the processes\nA <-> A + A, and A -> 0, which map onto Reggeon field theory with the critical\nexponents of directed percolation (DP). For branching and annihilating random\nwalks (BARW) A -> (m+1) A and A + A -> 0, the mean-field rate equation predicts\nan active state only. Yet BARW with odd m display a DP transition for d <= 2.\nFor even offspring number m, the particle number parity is conserved locally.\nBelow d_c' = 4/3, this leads to the emergence of an inactive phase that is\ncharacterized by the power laws of the pair annihilation process. The critical\nexponents at the transition are those of the `parity-conserving' (PC)\nuniversality class. For local processes without memory, competing pair or\ntriplet annihilation and fission reactions k A -> (k - l) A, k A -> (k+m)A with\nk=2,3 appear to yield the only other universality classes not described by\nmean-field theory.

Under\nthe assumption that the resulting coupling of these mesons to the constituent\nquarks is identical, the sigma meson mass is determined as M_sigma=385.4 MeV.\nWe discuss in detail the gauging of the non-local meson-quark interaction and\ncalculate the electromagnetic form factor of the pion and the form factors of\nthe pi(0) -> gamma gamma and sigma -> gamma gamma processes. We obtain explicit\nexpressions for the relevant form factors and evaluate the leading and\nnext-to-leading orders for large Euclidean photon virtualities. Turning to the\ndecay properties of the sigma we determine the width of the electromagnetic\nsigma -> gamma gamma transition and discuss the strong decay sigma -> pi pi. In\na final step we compute the nonleptonic decays D -> sigma pi and B -> sigma pi\nrelevant for the possible observation of the sigma meson. All our results are\ncompared to available experimental data and to results of other theoretical\nstudies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Apr 2003 15:27:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Jun 2003 08:42:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
