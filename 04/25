We propose a\nsolution to these ``cooling flow'' problems wherein energy is supplied to the\nplasma by hadronic cosmic rays (CRs). The solution requires an energy\ndeposition more intense and more distributed than in conventional CR models,\nbut this alternative model is also successful in describing the origin of CRs,\nas well as the properties of gamma ray bursts and of the diffuse gamma\nbackground radiation. The X-ray energy emitted by clusters is supplied, in a\nquasi-steady state, by the hadronic CRs, which act as ``warming rays''. The\ntemperature distribution in the intracluster space is successfully predicted\nfrom the measured plasma-density distribution. Four other puzzling features of\nclusters can also be explained in simple terms: the discrepancy between their\n``virial'' and ``lensing'' masses, their large magnetic fields, the correlation\nbetween their optical and X-ray luminosities, and the non-thermal tail of their\nX-ray spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Apr 2003 16:35:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We\npresent an analytical model for smooth accretion, including both preheating and\nradiative cooling, that links a cluster's entropy distribution to its mass\naccretion history and shows that smooth accretion overproduces the entropy\nobserved in massive clusters by a factor ~2-3, depending on the mass accretion\nrate. Any inhomogeneity in the accreting gas reduces entropy production at the\naccretion shock; thus, smoothing of the gas accreting onto a cluster raises its\nentropy level. Because smooth accretion produces more entropy than hierarchical\naccretion, we suggest that some of the observed differences between clusters\nand groups may arise because preheating smooths the smaller-scale lumps of gas\naccreting onto groups more effectively than it smooths the larger-scale lumps\naccreting onto clusters. This effect may explain why entropy levels at the\noutskirts of groups are ~2-3 times larger than expected from self-similar\nscaling arguments.

Simulation indicates that at\nlow inclination angle the line is registered by distant observer with\ncharacteristic two-peak profile. However, at high inclination angles ($> 85\n\\degr$) two additional peaks arise. This phenomenon was discovered by Matt,\nPerola, Stella (1993) using the Schwarzschild black hole metric to analyze such\neffect. They assumed that the effect is applicable to a Kerr metric far beyond\nof a range of parameters that they exploited. We check and confirm their\nhypothesis about such structure of the spectral line shape for a Kerr metric\ncase. We use no astrophysical assumptions about physical structure of the\nemission region except assumption that the region should be narrow enough.\n  Positions and heights of these extra peaks drastically depends on both the\nradial coordinate of the emitting region (circular hot spot) and the\ninclination angle. We find that best conditions to observe this effect are\nrealized at $\\theta > 85\\degr$ and $r > 5r_g$ and may exist in microquasars or\nlow-mass black holes in X-ray binary systems, because there is some precession\n(and nutation of accretion disks) with not very long time periods (see, for\nexample, SS433 binary system). The line profiles for different inclination\nangles and radial coordinates are presented. To analyze an influence of disk\nmodels on the spectral line shapes we simulate the line profiles for Shakura --\nSunyaev disk model for accretion disks with the high inclination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Apr 2003 10:18:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We start with a discussion of\nthe HST follow-up observations of the microlensing events toward the LMC\ndetected in the first 5 years of the experiment. Using color-magnitude diagrams\nwe attempt to distinguish between two possible locations of the microlensing\nsources: 1) in the LMC or 2) behind the LMC. We conclude that unless the\nextinction is extremely patchy, it is very unlikely that most of the LMC events\nhave sources behind the LMC. During an examination of the HST images of the 13\nLMC events we found a very red object next to the source star of event LMC-5.\nAstrometry, microlensing parallax fit, and a spectrum suggest that in this case\nwe directly image the lens - a low-mass disk star.\n  Then we focus on the majority of events observed by the MACHO Project, which\nare detected toward the Galactic bulge. We argue that the microlensing optical\ndepth toward the bulge is best measured using events that have clump giant\nsources, which are almost unaffected by blending. From this sample we derive a\nlow optical depth toward the Galactic bulge of (1.4 +/- 0.3) x 10^{-6}, in good\nagreement with other observational constraints and with theoretical models.

Thus superfluid turbulence is thought to hold the key to new\nunderstanding on turbulence in general. The fermion superfluid 3He offers\nfurther possibilities owing to a large variation in its hydrodynamic\ncharacteristics over the experimentally accessible temperatures. While studying\nthe hydrodynamics of the B phase of superfluid 3He, we discovered a sharp\ntransition at 0.60Tc between two regimes, with regular behaviour at\nhigh-temperatures and turbulence at low-temperatures.

Since approximate counting or sampling planar curves\nwith more than a few dozens of intersections is an open problem, direct\nconfrontation with numerical data yields no convincing indication on the\ncorrectness of our conjectures.

We study\nfunctionals on random search trees that satisfy recurrence relations of a\nsimple additive form. Many important functionals including the space\nrequirement, internal path length, and the so-called shape functional fall\nunder this framework. Our goal is to derive asymptotics of moments and identify\nlimiting distributions of these functionals under two commonly studied\nprobability models -- the random permutation model and the uniform model.\n  For the random permutation model, our approach is based on establishing\ntransfer theorems that link the order of growth of the input into a particular\ndeterministic recurrence to the order of growth of the output. For the uniform\nmodel, our approach is based on the complex-analytic tool of singularity\nanalysis. To facilitate a systematic analysis of these additive functionals we\nextend singularity analysis, a class of methods by which one can translate on a\nterm-by-term basis an asymptotic expansion of a functional around its dominant\nsingularity into a corresponding expansion for the Taylor coefficients of the\nfunction. The most important extension is the determination of how\nsingularities are composed under the operation of Hadamard product of analytic\npower series.\n  The transfer theorems derived are used in conjunction with the method of\nmoments to establish limit laws for m-ary search trees under the random\npermutation model. For the uniform model on binary search trees, the extended\nsingularity analysis toolkit is employed to establish the asymptotic behavior\nof the moments of a wide class of functionals. These asymptotics are used,\nagain in conjunction with the method of moments, to derive limit laws.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Apr 2003 15:02:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We investigate the\npossibilities this offers to modify the field. As a point of comparison we use\nthe solvable Rosen-Zener model, which has parameter dependencies roughly\nsimilar to the ones expected in a real cavity. We do confirm that by repeatedly\nsending atoms through the cavity, we can obtain filters on the photon states.\nHighly non-classical states can be obtained. We find that the Rosen-Zener model\nis more sensitive to the detuning than the case of a trigonometric coupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Apr 2003 13:01:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-10"}

The\nconstruction generalises a construction for nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equations.\nTo relate N^2 with physically motivated principles we assume: locality (i.e. it\ncontains no explicit derivative and no derivatives of the wave function),\nseparability (i.e. it acts on product states componentwise) and Poincar\\'e\ninvariance. Furthermore we want that a positional density is invariant under\nN^2. Such nonlinear transformations yield NLDE which describe physically\nequivalent systems. To get 'new' systems, we extend this NLDE (gauge extension)\nand present a family of NLDE which is a slight nonlinear generalisation of the\nDirac equation. We discuss and comment the fact that nonlinear evolutions are\nnot consistent with the usual framework of quantum theory. To develop a\ncorresponding extended framework one needs models for nonlinear evolutions\nwhich also indicate possible physical consequences of nonlinearities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Apr 2003 15:36:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
