The lower redshift and luminosity\nof most obscured AGNs mean that although they dominate the absorption-corrected\nintensity of the X-ray background by a factor of about 3 over unobscured\nobjects, they make only an equal contribution to the local mass density in\nblack holes. Obscured and unobscured AGNs together contribute about 4 x 10^5\nMsun/Mpc^3. Type 2 quasars and Compton-thick objects may give another 10^5\nMsun/Mpc^3, but no more unless direct determinations from the M-sigma relation\nseriously underestimate the local black hole mass density, or unless most\nmassive black holes are rapidly spinning (so having a higher radiative\nefficiency than the 10% assumed above). Obscured accretion probably dominates\nthe growth of black holes with masses below a few times 10^8 Msun, whereas\noptically bright quasars dominate at higher masses. The luminosity absorbed by\nthe dusty gas in obscured AGNs is reradiated in the mid-infrared and\nfar-infrared bands. The contribution of AGNs drops from about 20% of the\nmid-infrared background to just a few percent of the far-infrared background.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Apr 2003 16:05:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In particular, we assess the\nhypotheses that (1) star formation in spheroids and BH fueling are proportional\nto one another, and (2) the BH accretion luminosity stays near the Eddington\nlimit during luminous quasar phases. With the aid of this simple model, we are\nable to interpret many properties of the QSO luminosity function, including the\npuzzling steep decline of the characteristic luminosity from redshift z=2 to to\nz=0: indeed the residual star formation in spheroidal systems is today limited\nto a small number of bulges, characterized by stellar velocity dispersions a\nfactor of 2-3 smaller those of the elliptical galaxies hosting QSOs at z > 2. A\nsimple consequence of our hypotheses is that the redshift evolution of the QSO\nemissivity and of the star formation history in spheroids should be roughly\nparallel. We find this result to be broadly consistent with our knowledge of\nthe evolution of both the global star formation rate, and of the evolution of\nthe QSO emissivity, but we identify interesting discrepancies at both low and\nhigh redshifts, to which we offer tentative solutions. Finally, our hypotheses\nallow us to present a robust method to derive the duty cycle of QSO activity,\nbased on the observed QSO luminosity function, and on the present-day relation\nbetween the masses of supermassive BHs and those of their spheroidal host\nstellar systems. The duty cycle is found to be substantially less than unity,\nwith characteristic values in the range (3-6)x10^(-3), and we compute that the\naverage bolometric radiative efficiency is epsilon=0.07.

This\nsuggests that a population correction, based on the star formation rate (SFR)\nand age-metallicity relation (AMR) of a particular system, should be applied to\nthe local RC magnitude before it can be compared to the RC in that system in\norder to make a meaningful distance determination. Using a sample of 8 Galactic\nopen clusters and the GC 47 Tuc, we determine the cluster distances, and hence\nthe RC absolute magnitude in V, I and K, by applying our empirical main\nsequence fitting method, which utilizes a large sample of local field dwarfs\nwith accurate HIPPARCOS parallaxes. The age and metallicity range of these 9\nclusters enable us to make a quantitative assessment of the age and metallicity\ndependencies of the population corrections predicted by the theoretical models\nof Girardi & Salaris (2001).

Different\nattempts to explain this departure from normality have coexisted. In\nparticular, since one of the strong assumptions of the Gaussian model concerns\nthe volatility, considered finite and constant, the new models were built on a\nnon finite (Mandelbrot 1963) or non constant (Cox, Ingersoll and Ross 1985)\nvolatility. We investigate in this thesis a very recent model (Dragulescu et\nal. 2002) based on a Brownian motion process for the returns, and a stochastic\nmean-reverting process for the volatility. In this model, the forward\nKolmogorov equation that governs the time evolution of returns is solved\nanalytically. We test this new theory against different stock indexes (Dow\nJones Industrial Average, Standard and Poor s and Footsie), over different\nperiods (from 20 to 105 years). Our aim is to compare this model with the\nclassical Gaussian and with a simple Neural Network, used as a benchmark. We\nperform the usual statistical tests on the kurtosis and tails of the expected\ndistributions, paying particular attention to the outliers. As claimed by the\nauthors, the new model outperforms the Gaussian for any time lag, but is\nartificially too complex for medium and low frequencies, where the Gaussian is\npreferable. Moreover this model is still rejected for high frequencies, at a\n0.05 level of significance, due to the kurtosis, incorrectly handled.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Apr 2003 17:37:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

To circumvent this problem we need to\nspecify a gauge condition to fix the gauge so that the fields that are\nconnected by gauge invariance are not overcounted in the process of\nquantization. The usual way we do this in the light-front is through the\nintroduction of a Lagrange multiplier, $(n\\cdot A)^{2}$, where $n_{\\mu}$ is the\nexternal light-like vector, i.e., $n^{2}=0$, and $A_{\\mu}$ is the vector\npotential. This leads to the usual light-front propagator with all the ensuing\ncharacteristics such as the prominent $(k\\cdot n)^{-1}$ pole which has been the\nsubject of much research. However, it has been for long recognized that this\nprocedure is incomplete in that there remains a residual gauge freedom still to\nbe fixed by some ``ad hoc'' prescription, and this is normally worked out to\nremedy some unwieldy aspect that emerges along the way. In this work we propose\n\\emph{two} Lagrange multipliers with distinct coefficients for the light-front\ngauge that leads to the correctly defined propagator with no residual gauge\nfreedom left.
