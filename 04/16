Whereas the degree of polarization, $P$,\nwas found to vary in some sources, the position angle, $\\theta_p$, was roughly\nconstant in all cases. Until now, the polarization has been commonly attributed\nto synchrotron radiation from a jet with a tangled magnetic field that is\nviewed somewhat off axis. However, this model predicts either a peak in $P$ or\na $90^\\circ$ change in $\\theta_p$ around the ``jet break'' time in the\nlightcurve, for which there has so far been no observational confirmation. We\npropose an alternative interpretation, wherein the polarization is attributed,\nat least in part, to a large-scale, ordered magnetic field in the ambient\nmedium. The ordered component may dominate the polarization even if the total\nemissivity is dominated by a tangled field generated by postshock turbulence.\nIn this picture, $\\theta_p$ is roughly constant because of the uniformity of\nthe field, whereas $P$ varies as a result of changes in the ratio of the\nordered-to-random mean-squared field amplitudes. We point out that variable\nafterglow light curves should be accompanied by a variable polarization. The\nradiation from the original ejecta, which includes the prompt gamma-ray\nemission and the emission from the reverse shock (the `optical flash' and\n`radio flare'), could potentially exhibit a high degree of polarization (up to\n$\\sim 60%$) induced by an ordered transverse magnetic field advected from the\ncentral source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Apr 2003 16:19:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Aug 2003 19:19:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The gravitating part\nof the vacuum energy is adjusted to the energy density of matter and to other\ntypes of the perturbations of the vacuum. We discuss how the vacuum energy\nresponds (i) to the curvature of space in the Einstein closed Universe; (ii) to\nthe expansion rate in the de Sitter Universe; and (iii) to the rotation in the\nGoedel Universe. In all these steady state Universes, the gravitating vacuum\nenergy is zero in the absence of the perturbation, and is proportional to the\nenergy density of perturbation. This is in a full agreement with the\nthermodynamic Gibbs-Duhem relation applicable to any quantum vacuum. It\ndemonstrates that (i) the cosmological constant is not huge, since according to\nthe Gibbs-Duhem relation the contribution of zero point fluctuations to the\nvacuum energy is cancelled by the trans-Planckian degrees of freedom; (ii) the\ncosmological constant is non-zero, since the perturbations of the vacuum state\ninduce the non-zero vacuum energy; and (iii) the gravitating vacuum energy is\non the order of the energy density of matter and/or of other perturbations. We\nalso consider the vacuum response to the non-steady-state perturbations. In\nthis case the Einstein equations are modified to include the non-covariant\ncorrections, which are responsible for the relaxation of the cosmological\nconstant. The connection to the quintessence is demonstrated. The problem of\nthe energy-momentum tensor for the gravitational field is discussed in terms of\neffective gravity. The difference between the momentum and pseudo-momentum of\ngravitational waves in general relativity is similar to that for sound waves in\nhydrodynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Apr 2003 13:13:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Apr 2003 12:11:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 7 May 2003 13:46:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
