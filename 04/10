In fact,\nfrom spectroscopic measurements of the velocity of the broad-line region in\nquasars, it has now proved possible to obtain an independent dynamical estimate\nof the masses of the black holes that power quasars. I summarize recent results\nfrom this work, which can be used to demonstrate that the black hole-spheroid\nmass ratio in quasars is the same as that found for quiescent galaxies, namely\nM_bh = 0.0012 M_sph. These results offer the exciting prospect of using\nobservations of quasars and their hosts to extend the study of the black\nhole-spheroid mass ratio out to very high redshifts (z > 2). Moreover, there is\nnow good evidence that certain ultraviolet quasar emission lines can provide\nrobust estimates of black hole masses from the observed optical spectra of\nquasars out to z > 2, and perhaps even at z > 4. By combining such information\nwith deep, high-resolution infrared imaging of high-redshift quasar hosts on\n8-m class telescopes, there is now a real prospect of clarifying the evolution\nof the black hole spheroid connection over cosmological time scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Apr 2003 18:41:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The explosion is supposed to\nbe driven by bipolar jets which are powered by accretion onto a central\nremnant. We explore the features of the explosions with varying progenitors'\nmasses and jet properties. The outcomes are different from conventional\nspherical models. (1) In the bipolar models, Fe-rich materials are ejected at\nhigh velocities along the jet axis, while O-rich materials occupy the central\nregion whose density becomes very high as a consequence of continuous accretion\nfrom the side. This configuration can explain some peculiar features in the\nlight curves and the nebular spectra of hypernovae. (2) Production of $^{56}$Ni\ntends to be smaller than in spherical thermal bomb models. To account for a\nlarge amount of $^{56}$Ni observed in hypernovae, the jets should be initiated\nwhen the compact remnant mass is still smaller than $2-3\\msun$, or the jets\nshould be very massive and slow. (3) Ejected isotopes are distributed as\nfollows in order of decreasing velocities: $^{64}$Zn, $^{59}$Co, $^{56}$Fe,\n$^{44}$Ti, and $^{4}$He at the highest velocities, $^{55}$Mn, $^{52}$Cr,\n$^{32}$S, and $^{28}$Si at the intermediate velocities, and $^{24}$Mg, $^{16}$O\nat the lowest velocities. (4) The abundance ratios (Zn, Co)/Fe are enhanced\nwhile the ratios (Mn, Cr)/Fe are suppressed. This can account for the abundance\npattern of extremely metal-poor stars.

In both OH mainlines (at 1665 and 1667 MHz), deep and narrow\nabsorption features were detected toward PSR B1849+00. In addition, we have\ndetected several absorption and emission features against B33.6+0.1, a nearby\nsupernova remnant (SNR). The most interesting result of this study is that a\npencil-sharp absorption sample against the PSR differs greatly from the\nlarge-angle absorption sample observed against the SNR. If both the PSR and the\nSNR probe the same molecular cloud then this finding has important implications\nfor absorption studies of the molecular medium, as it shows that the statistics\nof absorbing OH depends on the size of the background source. We also show that\nthe OH absorption against the PSR most likely originates from a small (<30\narcsec) and dense (>10^5 cm^-3) molecular clump.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Apr 2003 00:40:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Various\nsuggestions have been put forward to address these issues: that they might be\nexplained away by lessons from sonic black hole models; that the prediction is\nindeed successfully reproduced by quantum gravity; that the success of the link\nprovided by the prediction between black holes and thermodynamics justifies the\nprediction.\n  This paper explains the nature of the difficulties, and reviews the proposals\nthat have been put forward to deal with them.

The kinematic self-similarity\nvector is either parallel or orthogonal to the fluid flow in the perfect-fluid\nand vacuum cases, while the `tilted' case, i.e., neither parallel nor\northogonal case, is also treated in the dust case.
