However, the large error bars associated with these ages do not\nexclude the hypothesis that this event is the Laschamp.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Apr 2003 14:26:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Apr 2003 09:42:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The model is based\non the idea that waves in the zero-point field convey information from the\ndetectors to the source, stimulating the spontaneous emission of photons with\ndefinite polarizations. In order to match experimental data, the model is\naugmented with a further local assumption that the ``master'' photon (going\nback along the direction of the zero-point wave that triggered emission) will\nnot be detected if the polarizer is not in the same orientation as the\nstimulated wave. This model predicts a ratio of coincidences to singles of 1/3\ncompared to standard quantum mechanics' 2/3 for the 2-fold choice of modulator\nsettings, and predicts that a 20-fold choice of settings will yield a\ncoincidence ratio of 1/40 with the SQM ratio unchanged. Such an outcome should\nbe easily distinguishable given the Innsbruck group's measured efficiency of\n1/20 in their experiment. This model also predicts that a coincidence at\npolarizer settings (a,b,t) will never be correlated with its time-retarded\ncomplement setting, (a',b',t-2L/c), a prediction for whose test the limited\ndata publicly available at this time is inadequate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Apr 2003 15:15:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Apr 2003 22:59:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
