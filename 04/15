The corrugated surface is modelled by\nhaving a single $q$-mode lateral corrugation of a certain height. The lamellae\ndeform close to the surface as a result of chemical interaction with it. The\ncompetition between the energetic cost of elastic deformations and the gain in\nsurface energy determines whether parallel or perpendicular lamellar\norientation (with respect to the surface) is preferred.

An\nanalysis of the importance of explicit spin--orbit correlations in the\ndescription of the system is carried out by the auxiliary field diffusion Monte\nCarlo method. The improved nodal structure of the guiding function, constructed\nby explicitly considering these correlations, lowers the energy. The proposed\nspin--backflow orbitals can conveniently be used also in Green's Function Monte\nCarlo calculations of light nuclei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Apr 2003 16:49:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Our main theoretical result is a linear response\nformalism, expressing the fidelity and purity fidelity in terms of integrated\ntime autocorrelation function of the generator of the perturbation.\nSurprisingly, this relation predicts that the decay of fidelity is the slower\nthe faster the decay of correlations. In particular for a static\n(time-independent) perturbation, and for non-ergodic and non-mixing dynamics\nwhere asymptotic decay of correlations is absent, a qualitatively different and\nfaster decay of fidelity is predicted on a time scale 1/delta as opposed to\nmixing dynamics where the fidelity is found to decay exponentially on a\ntime-scale 1/delta^2, where delta is a strength of perturbation. A detailed\ndiscussion of a semi-classical regime of small effective values of Planck\nconstant is given where classical correlation functions can be used to predict\nquantum fidelity decay. Note that the correct and intuitively expected\nclassical stability behavior is recovered in the classical limit, as the\nperturbation and classical limits do not commute. The theoretical results are\ndemonstrated numerically for two models, the quantized kicked top and the\nmulti-level Jaynes Cummings model.
