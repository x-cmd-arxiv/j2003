There it was demonstrated that, by applying a\nconsistent quantization scheme to a classical model of a spinless relativistic\nparticle as well as to the Berezin-Marinov model of 3+1 Dirac particle, it is\npossible to obtain a consistent relativistic quantum mechanics of such\nparticles. In the present article we apply a similar approach to the problem of\nquantizing the massive 2+1 Dirac particle. However, we stress that such a\nproblem differs in a nontrivial way from the one in 3+1 dimensions. The point\nis that in 2+1 dimensions each spin polarization describes different fermion\nspecies. Technically this fact manifests itself through the presence of a\nbifermionic constant and of a bifermionic first-class constraint. In\nparticular, this constraint does not admit a conjugate gauge condition at the\nclassical level. The quantization problem in 2+1 dimensions is also interesting\nfrom the physical viewpoint (e.g. anyons). In order to quantize the model, we\nfirst derive a classical formulation in an effective phase space, restricted by\nconstraints and gauges. Then the condition of preservation of the classical\nsymmetries allows us to realize the operator algebra in an unambiguous way and\nconstruct an appropriate Hilbert space. The physical sector of the constructed\nquantum mechanics contains spin-1/2 particles and antiparticles without an\ninfinite number of negative-energy levels, and exactly reproduces the\none-particle sector of the 2+1 quantum theory of a spinor field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Nov 2003 01:48:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Jan 2004 22:19:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

This is the finding of microscopic metallic lead tear drops in\nthe fluvial strata of the early Triassic sandstones that overlie Permian coal\nbeds and other sedimentary deposits in the Sydney basin of Australia. Elemental\nlead is almost unknown in nature, so its occurrence in these graphite-loaded\nsandstones is a provocative finding. While climate change and vulcanism could\nexplain the carbon and sulfur anomalies, the only way to account for metallic\nlead aerodynamic droplets is by massive impact and vaporization of lead\nmineral-containing formations. Since lead occurs geologically as the sulfide\nand since lead is an easily reduced element, its occurrence in conjunction with\nsulfur and carbon count anomalies suggests a bolide impact on carbon-loaded\nstrata in a sulfide mineral-rich region. From these clues, and from stream\ncross-bedding data, we identify a probable site for the impact, in Bass Strait\nbetween Tasmania and Victoria. A gravitational anomaly, similar to that known\nat the site of the Cretacious-Tertiary (C-T) impact site, conforms with a\ncentral uplift. The sudden compression at an Australian impact site would\nprovoke tension fissuring on the opposite side of a shell- structured planet,\nhence is consistent with the unprecedented flood basalts initiated in Siberia\nat the P-T boundary. Our interpretation requires that lead microspheres and\ngraphite occur together elsewhere, possibly in Antarctic sandstones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Nov 2003 02:34:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Jan 2004 01:03:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Such an approach allows for a\nqualitative understanding of network dynamics in a lack of empirical data\nconcerning the large genomes of living organisms. Local dynamics of network\nnodes exhibits the multistationarity and oscillations and depends crucially\nupon the global topology of a \"maximal\" graph (comprising of all possible\ninteractions between genes in the network). The long time behavior observed in\nthe network defined on the homogeneous \"maximal\" graphs is featured by the\nfraction of positive interactions ($0\\leq \\eta\\leq 1$) allowed between genes.\nThere exists a critical value $\\eta_c<1$ such that if $\\eta<\\eta_c$, the\noscillations persist in the system, otherwise, when $\\eta>\\eta_c,$ it tends to\na fixed point (which position in the phase space is determined by the initial\nconditions and the certain layout of switching parameters).
