Here we analyze (i) average z\ncoordinates of the carbon atoms and interdigitation of the hydrocarbon\nbilayers, (ii) density profiles and (iii) pressure profiles of the structures\nalong all Cartesian axes. In C18-mica, the standard deviation in the z\ncoordinate for the chain atoms is high and more than doubles in the disordered\nphase. The order-disorder transition is accompanied by a change in the\norientation of the ammonium headgroup, as well as decreasing tensile and shear\nstress in the disordered phase. In 2C18-mica, the standard deviation in the z\ncoordinate for the chain atoms is low and does not increase remarkably on\nheating. The backbones display a highly regular structure, which is slightly\nobscured by rotations in the C18 backbones and minor headgroup displacements at\n100 deg C. Close contacts between the bulky headgroups with sidearms cause\nsignificant local pressure which is in part not relieved at 100 deg C. An\nincrease of the basal-plane spacing at higher temperature is found in both\nsystems due to larger separation between the two hydrocarbon layers and an\nincreased z spacing between adjacent chain atoms (=decreased tilt of the chains\nrelative to the surface normal), and, in C18-mica only, a stronger upward\norientation of the C18 chain at the ammonium headgroup.

A one-loop field theory computation, which involves\nsolving a Heisenberg chain by means of the Bethe ansatz agrees with the large\nangular momentum limit of a rotating string. We point out that the Heisenberg\nchain can be equally well solved by using a sigma model approach. Moreover we\nalso show that a certain limit, akin to the BMN limit, leads exactly to the\nsame sigma model for a string rotating with large angular momentum.

As an upshot we propose that the\nrotating string should be identified with a coherent, semi-classical state\nbuilt out of the eigenstates of the spin chain. The agreement is then complete.\nFor example we show that the mean value of the spin <S> gives, precisely, the\nposition of the string in the bulk.

The noncommutativity of the conservation laws that leads to an\nemergence of internal forces and an appearance of the nonequilibrium is a cause\nof development of instability in material media (material systems). These\nresults were obtained with the help of the mathematical apparatus of\nskew-symmetric differential forms. To study the causes of developing\ninstability it is necessary to inspect the evolutionary relation obtained from\nequations of the balance conservation laws and to analyze the differential form\ncommutator that enters into this relation. In the present work the method of\nskew-symmetric differential forms has been applied in study of the\nthermodynamical and gas dynamical systems. It was shown that the principle of\nthermodynamics follows from two conservation laws, namely, the balance\nconservation laws for energy and linear momentum. In this case the second\nprinciple of thermodynamics, from which the state function (which specifies a\nstate of the thermodynamical system) is obtained, follows from the first\nprinciple. A mechanism of development of instability in gas dynamical systems\nis described and there are explained such processes as emergence of waves,\nvortices, turbulent pulsations and so on.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Nov 2003 14:54:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This\nleads to the\"random-completion problem\" of DNA replication in embryos, where\none needs to find a mechanism that ensures complete, faithful, timely\nreproduction of the genome without any sequence dependence of replication\norigins. We analyze recent DNA replication data in Xenopus laevis egg extracts\nand find discrepancies with models where replication origins are distributed\nindependently of chromatin structure. Motivated by these discrepancies, we have\ninvestigated the role that chromatin looping may play in DNA replication. We\nfind that the loop-size distribution predicted from a wormlike-chain model of\nchromatin can account for the spatial distribution of replication origins in\nthis system quantitatively. Together with earlier findings of increasing\nfrequency of origin firings, our results can explain the random-completion\nproblem. The agreement between experimental data (molecular combing) and\ntheoretical predictions suggests that the intrinsic stiffness of chromatin\nloops plays a fundamental biological role in DNA replication in early-embryo\nXenopus in regulating the origin spacing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Nov 2003 06:17:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-06"}

Recent experiments and molecular data suggest that the\nindividual repair enzymes do not work independently of each other, but rather\ninteract with each other through currents exchanged along DNA. A damaged site\nin DNA hinders this exchange and this makes it possible to quickly free up\nresources from error free stretches of DNA. Here the size of the speedup gained\nfrom this current exchange mechanism is calculated and the characteristic\nlength and time scales are identified. In particular for Escherichia coli we\nestimate the speedup to be 50000/N, where N is the number of repair enzymes\nparticipating in the current exchange mechanism. Even though N is not exactly\nknown a speedup of order 10 is not entirely unreasonable. Furthermore upon over\nexpression of repair enzymes the detection time only varies as one over the\nsquareroot of N and not as 1/N. This behavior is of interest in assessing the\nimpact of stress full and radioactive environments on individual cell mutation\nrates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Nov 2003 14:17:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Quantum interference of these two states, which is determined\nby a frequency-dependent phase angle, can be exploited to perform various\ntwo-qubit transformations.

Armed with this class of heat\nengines and some interpretation of heat transferred and work performed at the\nquantum level, we are able to clarify some important aspects of the second law\nof thermodynamics. In particular, it is not sufficient to have the heat source\nhotter than the sink, but there must be a minimum temperature difference\nbetween the hotter source and the cooler sink before any work can be extracted\nthrough the engines. The size of this minimum temperature difference is\ndictated by that of the energy gaps of the quantum engines involved. Our new\nquantum heat engines also offer a practical way, as an alternative to Szilard's\nengine, to physically realise Maxwell's daemon. Inspired and motivated by the\nRabi oscillations, we further introduce some modifications to the quantum heat\nengines with single-mode cavities in order to, while respecting the second law,\nextract more work from the heat baths than is otherwise possible in thermal\nequilibria. Some of the results above are also generalisable to quantum heat\nengines of an infinite number of energy levels including 1-D simple harmonic\noscillators and 1-D infinite square wells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Nov 2003 08:07:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Dec 2003 00:31:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 20 Dec 2003 14:19:26 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 2 Feb 2004 06:03:45 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2005 13:26:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
