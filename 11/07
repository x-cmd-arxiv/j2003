For cloud\nmodels with parameters typical of dense cores, the results show that the dust\ntemperature decreases monotonically from a maximum value near the cloud's edge\n(14-15 K) to a minimum value at the cloud's center (6-7 K).

This star was discovered in the course of follow-up\nmedium-resolution spectroscopy of extremely metal-poor candidates selected from\nthe digitized Hamburg/ESO objective-prism survey. On the basis of\nhigh-resolution VLT/UVES spectra, we derive abundances for 8 elements (C, N,\nNa, Mg, Ca, Ti, Fe, and Ni), and upper limits for another 12 elements. A\nplane-parallel LTE model atmosphere has been specifically tailored for the\nchemical composition of {\\he}. Scenarios for the origin of the abundance\npattern observed in the star are discussed. We argue that HE0107-5240 is most\nlikely not a post-AGB star, and that the extremely low abundances of the\niron-peak, and other elements, are not due to selective dust depletion. The\nabundance pattern of HE0107-5240 can be explained by pre-enrichment from a\nzero-metallicity type-II supernova of 20-25M_Sun, plus either self-enrichment\nwith C and N, or production of these elements in the AGB phase of a formerly\nmore massive companion, which is now a white dwarf. However, significant radial\nvelocity variations have not been detected within the 52 days covered by our\nmoderate-and high-resolution spectra. Alternatively, the abundance pattern can\nbe explained by enrichment of the gas cloud from which HE0107-5240 formed by a\n25M_Sun first-generation star exploding as a subluminous SNII, as proposed by\nUmeda & Nomoto (2003).

Since the development of the causal interpretation of\nrelativistic boson fields there have not been any applications for which the\nequations of motion for the field have been solved explicitly. Here, we provide\nperhaps the first application of the causal interpretation of boson fields for\nwhich the equations of motion are solved. Specifically, we consider the\nelectromagnetic field. Solving the equations of motion allows us to develop a\nrelativistic causal model of the Wheeler delayed-choice Mach-Zehnder\nInterferometer. We show explicitly that a photon splits at a beam splitter. We\nalso demonstrate the inherent nonlocal nature of a relativistic quantum field.\nThis is particularly revealed in a which-path measurement where a quantum is\nnonlocally absorbed from both arms of the interferometer. This feature explains\nhow when a photon is split by a beam splitter it nevertheless registers on a\ndetector in one arm of the interferometer. Bohm et al \\cite{BDH85} have argued\nthat a causal model of a Wheeler delayed-choice experiment avoids the paradox\nof creating or changing history, but they did not provide the details of such a\nmodel. The relativistic causal model we develop here serves as a detailed\nexample which demonstrates this point, though our model is in terms of a field\npicture rather than the particle picture of the Bohm-de Broglie nonrelativistic\ncausal interpretation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Nov 2003 16:14:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Nov 2003 18:11:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 Nov 2003 11:50:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 13 Nov 2003 15:41:35 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 28 Nov 2003 12:13:11 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2006 13:32:26 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Thu, 9 Nov 2017 17:41:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-10"}

Using the number of repetitions which is independent of $M$ and\nlinearly dependent on $q$, we get the error bound of order $M^{-1}$ for any $q\n\\in [1,\\infty)$.
