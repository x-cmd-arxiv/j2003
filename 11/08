Using the perturbative fragmentation function\nformalism we then resum with NLL accuracy large collinear logs of the ratio of\nbottom-to-top mass, which leads to an essential improvement of the result. Next\nwe perform the threshold resummation for the coefficient function for top decay\nwith NLL accuracy.

The field is called a Kummer field or a Kummer\nextension of $\\F_q$. It plays an important role in improving the AKS primality\nproving algorithm. It is known that we can efficiently construct an element $g$\nwith order greater than $2^n$ in the fields. Let $S_q(\\bullet)$ be the function\nfrom integers to the sum of digits in their $q$-ary expansions. We present an\nalgorithm that given $g^e$ ($ 0\\leq e < q^n $) finds $e$ in random polynomial\ntime, provided that $S_q (e) < n$. We then show that the problem is solvable in\nrandom polynomial time for most of the exponent $e$ with $S_q (e) < 1.32 n $.\nThe main tool for the latter result is the Guruswami-Sudan list decoding\nalgorithm. Built on these results, we prove that in the field $\\F_{q^{q-1}}$,\nthe bounded sum-of-digits discrete logarithm with respect to $g$ can be\ncomputed in random time $O(f(w) \\log^4 (q^{q-1}))$, where $f$ is a\nsubexponential function and $w$ is the bound on the $q$-ary sum-of-digits of\nthe exponent. Hence the problem is fixed parameter tractable. These results are\nshown to be extendible to Artin-Schreier extension $\\F_{p^p}$ where $p$ is a\nprime. Since every finite field has an extension of reasonable degree which is\na Kummer field, our result reveals an unexpected property of the discrete\nlogarithm problem, namely, the bounded sum-of-digits discrete logarithm problem\nin any given finite field becomes polynomial time solvable in certain low\ndegree extensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Nov 2003 20:33:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It proposes that new mathematical work related to functional\nneural network designs -- designs so functional that they can be used in\nengineering -- is essential to a functional understanding of intelligence as\nsuch, and outlines some key mathematics as of 1999, citing earlier work for\nmore details. Quantum theory is relevant, but not in the simple ways proposed\nin more popular philosophies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Nov 2003 17:11:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The computational community has paid\nconsiderable attention to this problem; however, the associated time scale,\ntypically on the order of milliseconds or more, represents a formidable\nchallenge. Ab initio protein folding from long molecular dynamics (MD)\nsimulations or ensemble dynamics is not feasible with ordinary computing\nfacilities and new techniques must be introduced. Here we present a detailed\nstudy of the folding of a 16-residue beta-hairpin, described by a generic\nenergy model and using the activation-relaxation technique. From a total of 90\ntrajectories at 300 K, three folding pathways emerge. All involve a\nsimultaneous optimization of the complete hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding\ninteractions. The first two follow closely those observed by previous\ntheoretical studies. The third pathway, never observed by previous all-atom\nfolding, unfolding and equilibrium simulations, can be described as a reptation\nmove of one strand of the beta-sheet with respect to the other. This reptation\nmove indicates that non-native interactions can play a dominant role in the\nfolding of secondary structures. These results point to a more complex folding\npicture than expected for a simple beta-hairpin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Nov 2003 00:14:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
