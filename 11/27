We then consider a set of transformation rules\nwhich extend the ones used for partial evaluation, and we propose a strategy\nfor guiding the application of these extended rules so to derive very efficient\nspecialized programs. The efficiency improvements which sometimes are\nexponential, are due to the reduction of nondeterminism and to the fact that\nthe computations which are performed by the initial programs in different\nbranches of the computation trees, are performed by the specialized programs\nwithin single branches. In order to reduce nondeterminism we also make use of\nmode information for guiding the unfolding process. To exemplify our technique,\nwe show that we can automatically derive very efficient matching programs and\nparsers for regular languages. The derivations we have performed could not have\nbeen done by previously known partial evaluation techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Nov 2003 10:04:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The\ncorresponding exact solution describes an impulsive gravitational wave\npropagating in the static, cylindrically symmetric, electrovac universe of\nMelvin, and for a vanishing electromagnetic field it reduces to the well known\nAichelburg-Sexl pp-wave. In the boosting process, the original Petrov type I of\nthe Schwarzschild-Melvin solution simplifies to the type II on the impulse, and\nto the type D elsewhere. The geometry of the wave front is studied, in\nparticular its non-constant Gauss curvature.

It is a long held believe that they\nare good probes of physics at the GUT scale. Recent developments have made it\nclear that they can also be of fundamental importance for the physics of extra\ndimensions if these exist. Here we pedagogically review the construction of\nneutrino mass models in extra dimensions within the brane world scenarios.\nThese models are usually nontrivial generalizations of their four dimensional\ncounterparts. We describe the theoretical tools that have been forged and the\nnew perpectives gained in this rapidly developing area. In particular we\ndiscuss the issues involve in building models without the use of right-handed\nsinglets. It is very difficult to directly test the origin of neutrino masses\nin different models be it in four or more dimensions. We point out that\ndifferent models give very different indirect signatures in the TeV region and\nin precision measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Nov 2003 22:46:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-17"}

In very dilute solutions, single-stranded DNA is\nadsorbed at the interface in a salt-dependent manner. At high salt\nconcentrations the adsorption is irreversible. The adsorption of the\nsingle-stranded DNA is specific to phenol and relies on stacking and hydrogen\nbonding. We establish the interfacial nature of a DNA renaturation at a high\nsalt concentration. In the absence of shaking, this reaction involves an\nefficient surface diffusion of the single-stranded DNA chains. In the presence\nof a vigorous shaking, the bimolecular rate of the reaction exceeds the\nSmoluchowski limit for a three-dimensional diffusion-controlled reaction. DNA\nrenaturation in these conditions is known as the Phenol Emulsion Reassociation\nTechnique or PERT. Our results establish the interfacial nature of PERT. A\ncomparison of this interfacial reaction with other approaches shows that PERT\nis the most efficient technique and reveals similarities between PERT and the\nrenaturation performed by single-stranded nucleic acid binding proteins. Our\nresults lead to a better understanding of the partitioning of nucleic acids in\ntwo-phase systems, and should help design improved extraction procedures for\ndamaged nucleic acids. We present arguments in favor of a role of phenol and\nwater-phenol interface in prebiotic chemistry. The most efficient renaturation\nreactions (in the presence of condensing agents or with PERT) occur in\nheterogeneous systems. This reveals the limitations of homogeneous approaches\nto the biochemistry of nucleic acids.
