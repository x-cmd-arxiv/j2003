We find a new spectral window\nfor observing the self-gravitating accretion disc in super-Eddington accreting\nActive Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). This window is determined by calculating the\noutermost radius (rsg) of a non self-gravitating disc and the corresponding\nemission wavelength (lsg) as a function of various disc parameters. We find\nthat lsg reaches ~ 4000 AA for alpha=0.1, when Mdot > 70 (M_BH / 10^7 M_Sun)^-1\nL_Edd/c^2 (where alpha, Mdot, M_BH and L_Edd are, respectively, the viscosity\nparameter, gas accretion rate onto the central black hole (BH), the BH mass and\nthe Eddington luminosity). Moreover, lsg is as small as 1500 AA for alpha =\n0.001, which is the smallest alpha case in this study. Therefore, the window\nfor observing the self-gravitating part of an AGN accretion disc is from 2\nmicron to lsg. Incidentally, rsg can be less than the photon trapping radius\nfor Mdot >~ 10^3.3 L_Edd/c^2. Namely, a self-gravitating, optically-thick,\nadvection-dominated accretion disc is expected to appear in the extremely high\naccretion rate regime.\n  Next, we demonstrate that the Mid-Infrared to X-ray spectrum of a bright,\nwell-studied Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxy, Ton S 180, is indeed well fitted by\nthe spectrum arising from the following three components: an inner slim disc\n(with a corona), an outer, self-gravitating non-Keplerian disc and a dusty\ntorus. The total mass, BH mass plus the entire disc mass, is found to be about\n(1.4 - 8.0) M_BH. If the surface density varies with radius r in proportion to\nr^-0.6, the total mass is consistent with the central mass estimated by H_beta\nand [O III] widths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Nov 2003 17:38:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

For sources involving binary systems, accreting white dwarfs and\naccreting neutron stars with main sequence companions have been proposed. Among\nthe accreting neutron star systems, previous studies have focused on stellar\nwind-fed sources. In this paper, we point out that binary systems in which mass\ntransfer occurs via Roche lobe overflow (RLOF) can also contribute to this\nX-ray source population.\n  A binary population synthesis study of the Galactic center region has been\ncarried out, and it is found that evolutionary channels for neutron star\nformation involving the accretion induced collapse of a massive ONeMg white\ndwarf, in addition to the core collapse of massive stars, can contribute to\nthis population.

In this contribution, we report on recent\nhydrodynamic simulations of radiative shock-cloud interactions using two\ndifferent cooling models: an equilibrium cooling-curve model assuming solar\nmetallicities and a non-equilibrium chemistry model appropriate for primordial\ngas clouds. We consider a range of initial cloud densities and shock speeds in\norder to quantify the role of cooling in the evolution.

We focus on the accretion rate distribution p(mdot|M,z), the\nprobability that a black hole of mass M at redshift z accretes at a rate mdot\nin Eddington units. Given the radiative efficiency as a function of mdot, the\nquasar luminosity function (QLF) is determined by a convolution of p(mdot|M,z)\nwith the black hole mass function n(M,z). In the absence of mergers p(mdot|M,z)\nalso determines the full evolution of n(M,z), given a \"boundary value\" of n(M)\nat some redshift. Matching the observed decline of the QLF break luminosity at\nz<2 requires either a shift towards lower characteristic accretion rates or an\nevolving mass dependence of p(mdot) that preferentially shuts off accretion\nonto high mass black holes. These two scenarios make different predictions for\nthe masses and accretion rates of active black holes. If the first mechanism\ndominates, then the QLF changes character between z=2 and z=0, shifting from a\nsequence of black hole mass towards a sequence of L/Ledd. We construct and\ncompare five models that illustrate different assumptions about the quasar\npopulation: short and long lifetime models dominated by unobscured thin-disk\naccretion, a model with a high fraction of obscured quasars, and models in\nwhich mergers or ADAF accretion produce substantial black hole growth at low\nredshift.

Plasticity is modeled using non-convex\ninterparticle potentials that allow for phase slips. This theory most naturally\ndescribes sliding charge density waves; other applications include flow of\ncolloidal particles or driven magnetic flux vortices in disordered backgrounds.\nThe phase diagrams exhibit generic phases and phase boundaries, though the\nshapes of the phase boundaries depend on the shape of the disorder potential.\nThe phases are distinguished by their velocity and coherence: the moving phase\ngenerically has finite coherence, while pinned states can be coherent or\nincoherent. The coherent and incoherent static phases can coexist in parameter\nspace, in contrast with previous results for exactly sinusoidal pinning\npotentials. Transitions between the moving and static states can also be\nhysteretic. The depinning transition from the static to sliding states can be\ndetermined analytically, while the repinning transition from the moving to the\npinned phases is computed by direct simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Nov 2003 16:35:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

It is known that stability of a fluid model implies positive\n(Harris) recurrence (stability) of a corresponding stochastic queueing network,\nand weak stability implies rate stability of a corresponding stochastic\nnetwork. These results have been established both for cases of specific\nscheduling policies and for the class of all work conserving policies.\n  However, only partial converse results have been established and in certain\ncases converse statements do not hold. In this paper we close one of the\nexisting gaps. For the case of networks with two stations we prove that if the\nfluid model is not weakly stable under the class of all work conserving\npolicies, then a corresponding queueing network is not rate stable under the\nclass of all work conserving policies. We establish the result by building a\nparticular work conserving scheduling policy which makes the associated\nstochastic process transient. An important corollary of our result is that the\ncondition $\\rho^*\\leq 1$, which was proven in \\cite{daivan97} to be the exact\ncondition for global weak stability of the fluid model, is also the exact\nglobal rate stability condition for an associated queueing network.

As a consequence, that experiment was taken as an\nevidence that there is no ether and, as such, played a crucial role for\ndeciding between Lorentzian Relativity and Einstein's Special Relativity.\nHowever, according to some authors, the observed Earth's velocity was not\nnegligibly small. To provide an independent check, we have re-analyzed the\nfringe shifts observed in each of the six different sessions of the\nMichelson-Morley experiment.
