We confirm the large rotation of the PNe along\nthe major axis, and show that it extends in a disk-like feature into the halo.\nThe rotation curve of the stars flattens at ~100 km/s with V/sigma between 1\nand 1.5, and with the velocity dispersion of the PNe falling gradually at\nlarger radii. The two-dimensional velocity field exhibits a zero-velocity\ncontour with a pronounced twist, showing that the galaxy potential is likely\ntriaxial in shape, tending toward prolate.

In particular, we show how the constraints\ndue to the Ward identities, which implement the conservation laws associated\nwith the various symmetries, help to minimize the number of independent running\nvariables. This use of the Ward identities is examined both in the case of a\nstable phase and of a critical phenomenon. In the first case we consider the\nproblems of interacting fermions and bosons. In one dimension general and\nspecific Ward identities are sufficient to show the non-Fermi-liquid character\nof the interacting fermion system, and also allow to describe the crossover to\na Fermi liquid above one dimension. This crossover is examined both in the\nabsence and presence of singular interaction. On the other hand, in the case of\ninteracting bosons in the superfluid phase, the implementation of the Ward\nidentities provides the asymptotically exact description of the acoustic\nlow-energy excitation spectrum, and clarifies the subtle mechanism of how this\nis realized below and above three dimensions. As a critical phenomenon, we\ndiscuss the disorder-driven metal-insulator transition in a disordered\ninteracting Fermi system. In this case, through the use of Ward identities, one\nis able to associate all the disorder effects to renormalizations of the Landau\nparameters. As a consequence, the occurrence of a metal-insulator transition is\ndescribed as a critical breakdown of a Fermi liquid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Nov 2003 10:48:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The\nrules of quantum mechanics impose bounds on how multi-qubit systems can be\ncorrelated. In this paper we utilize a concept of entangled graphs with\nweighted edges in order to analyze pure quantum states of multi-qubit systems.\nHere qubits are represented by vertexes of the graph while the presence of\nbi-partite entanglement is represented by an edge between corresponding\nvertexes. The weight of each edge is defined to be the entanglement between the\ntwo qubits connected by the edge, as measured by the concurrence. We prove that\neach entangled graph with entanglement bounded by a specific value of the\nconcurrence can be represented by a pure multi-qubit state. In addition we\npresent a logic network with O(N2) elementary gates that can be used for\npreparation of the weighted entangled graphs of N qubits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Nov 2003 14:49:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
