We use steady state PDR models in order to\nexamine the sensitivity of different H2 line ratios to the H2 formation rate\nRf. We show that the ratio of the 0-0 S(3) to the 1-0 S(1) line increases with\nRf but that one requires independent estimates of the radiation field incident\nupon the PDR and the density in order to infer Rf from the H2 line data.

This theory introduces a new way to model the\nformation and evolution of halos, which traditionally have been investigated by\nanalytic gravitational infall models or numerical N-body methods. Unlike the\ncollisionless Boltzmann equation, our kinetic equation contains nonzero terms\non the right-hand side arising from stochastic fluctuations in the\ngravitational potential due to substructures in the dark matter mass\ndistribution. Using statistics for constrained Gaussian random fields in\nstandard cosmological models, we show that our kinetic equation to second-order\nin perturbation theory is of the Fokker-Planck form, with one scattering term\nrepresenting drift and the other representing diffusion in velocity-space. The\ndrift is radial, and the drift and diffusion coefficients depend only on\npositions and not velocities; our relaxation process in the quasilinear regime\nis therefore different from the standard two-body relaxation. We provide\nexplicit expressions relating these coefficients to the linear power spectrum\nof mass fluctuation and present results for the currently favored cold dark\nmatter model with a nonzero cosmological constant.

This is classified as Case C mass transfer.\nThese previous arguments were based chiefly on stellar evolution, especially\ndepending on the way in which 12C burned.\n  In this work we argue for Case C mass transfer on the basis of binary\nevolution. The giant progenitor of the black hole will have a large radius 1000\nRsun at the end of its supergiant stage. Its lifetime at that point will be\nshort, about 1000 yrs, so it will not expand much further. Thus, the initial\ngiant radius for Case C mass transfer will be constrained to a narrow band\nabout 1000 Rsun. This has the consequence that the final separation a_f\nfollowing common envelope evolution will depend nearly linearly on the mass of\nthe companion m_d which becomes the donor after the He core of the giant has\ncollapsed into the black hole. The separation at which this collapse takes\nplace is essentially a_f, because of the rapid evolution of the giant. (In at\nleast two binaries the black hole donor separation has been substantially\nincreased because of mass loss in the black hole formation. These can be\nreconstructed from the amount of mass deposited on the donor in this mass\nloss.)\n  We show that the reconstructed preexplosion separations of the black hole\nbinaries fit well the linear relationship.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Nov 2003 02:26:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We perform a calculation of a gauge field tadpole amplitude and show\nthat off-shell both the twisted and untwisted states give rise to non-trivial\nmomentum profiles over the orbifold C^3/Z_3. These profiles take the form of\nGaussian distributions integrated over the fundamental domain of the modular\nparameter of the torus. The propagators of the internal coordinate fields on\nthe torus world sheet determine the width of the Gaussian profiles. These\npropagators are determined up to a single normal ordering constant which must\nbe bounded below to allow the existence of the coordinate space representation\nof these Gaussians. Apart from the expected massless states, massive and even\ntachyonic string excitations contribute to the profiles in some anomalous U(1)\nmodels. However, when a tadpole is integrated over the internal dimensions,\nthese tachyonic contributions cancel in a non-trivial manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Nov 2003 19:25:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Nov 2003 17:34:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-03"}

This paper presents new algorithms for compiling arbitrary 2^n x\n2^n unitary matrices into efficient circuits of (n-1)-controlled single-qubit\nand (n-1)-controlled-NOT gates. We first present a general algebraic\noptimization technique, which we call the Palindrome Transform, that can be\nused to minimize the number of self-inverting gates in quantum circuits\nconsisting of concatenations of palindromic subcircuits. For a fixed column\nordering of two-level decomposition, we then give an numerative algorithm for\nminimal (n-1)-controlled-NOT circuit construction, which we call the\nPalindromic Optimization Algorithm. Our work dramatically reduces the number of\ngates generated by the conventional two-level decomposition method for\nconstructing quantum circuits of (n-1)-controlled single-qubit and\n(n-1)-controlled-NOT gates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Nov 2003 17:20:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

However, two-photon entanglement\ncan be witnessed by the interference manner. We demonstrate the necessary and\nsufficient conditions for the perfect two-photon interference.
