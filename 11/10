We find that\nbulge effective scalelength and luminosity increase with increasing n, but disk\nproperties are independent of bulge shape. As Hubble type T increases, bulges\nbecome less luminous and their mean effective surface brightness gets fainter;\ndisks shows a similar, but much weaker, trend. When bulge parameters are\ncompared with disk ones, they are tightly correlated for n=1 bulges. The\ncorrelations gradually worsen with increasing n such that n=4 bulges appear\nvirtually independent of their disks. The Kormendy relation, surf. brightness\nvs. effect. radius, is shown to depend on bulge shape; the two parameters are\ntightly correlated in n=4 bulges, and increasingly less so as n decreases;\ndisks are well correlated .Bulge-to-disk size ratios are independent of Hubble\ntype, but smaller for exponential bulges. Strongly barred SB galaxies with\nexponential bulges are more luminous than their unbarred counterparts.\nExponential bulges appear to be closely related to their underlying disks,\nwhile bulges with higher n values are less so. We interpret our results as\nbeing most consistent with a secular evolutionary scenario, in which\ndissipative processes in the disk are responsible for building up the bulges in\nmost spirals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Nov 2003 13:47:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

As a test of this late hot flasher scenario,\nwe have obtained and analysed medium resolution spectra of a sample of blue\nhook stars in NGC2808 to derive their atmospheric parameters. Using the same\nprocedures, we have also re-analyzed our earlier spectra of the blue hook stars\nin omega Cen (Moehler et al. 2002) for comparison with the present results for\nNGC2808. The blue hook stars in these two clusters are both hotter (Teff >\n35,000 K) and more helium-rich than canonical extreme HB stars in agreement\nwith the late hot flasher scenario. Moreover, we find indications for C\nenhancement in the three most He-enriched stars in NGC2808. However, the blue\nhook stars still show some H in their atmospheres, perhaps indicating that some\nresidual H survives a late hot flash and then later diffuses to the surface\nduring the HB phase.

The emphasis is on the flavor SU(3) structure of the\ncoupling constants and reliability in extracting the coupling constants from\nthe two-point correlation functions. We first calculate the baryon-diagonal\ncouplings and study the reliability of the sum rule. The F/D ratio of the\ncoupling is determined in the SU(3) limit. We further formulate the\nbaryon-off-diagonal couplings using the projected correlation functions and the\nvertex functions, so that the unwanted excited states do not contaminate the\nsum rule. As an example, the (\\pi - \\Lambda - \\Sigma) coupling constant is\ncalculated and the flavor SU(3) breaking effect is studied. We find that the\neffect of SU(3) breaking on the (\\pi - \\Lambda - \\Sigma) coupling constant is\nsmall.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Nov 2003 10:35:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-19"}

We employ a continuous time Markov\nmodel of codon substitution to distinguish mutation fixed by evolution and\nmutation fixed by chance. This model takes into account bias in codon\nfrequency, bias favoring transition over transversion, as well as explicit\nphylogenetic information.
