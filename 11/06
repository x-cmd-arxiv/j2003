Contrary to\nneutron stars, strange stars with T/|W| (the ratio of the rotational kinetic\nenergy to the absolute value of the gravitational potential energy) much lower\nthan the corresponding value for the mass-shed limit can be secularly unstable\nto bar mode formation if shear viscosity is high enough to damp out any\ndeviation from uniform rotation.

The non-thermal hard X-ray\ncluster emission (HXR) is detected at a 2 sigma level in 50% of the\nnon-significantly AGN-contaminated clusters: A2142, A2199, A2256, A3376, Coma,\nOphiuchus and Virgo. The data are consistent with a scenario whereby relaxed\nclusters have no hard X-ray component of non-thermal origin, whereas merger\nclusters do, with a 20-80 keV luminosity of 10^(43-44) erg/s. The co-added\nspectrum of the above clusters indicates a power-law spectrum for the HXR with\na photon index of 2.8+0.3-0.4 in the 12-115 keV band, and we find indication\nthat it has extended distribution. These indications argue against significant\ncontamination from obscured AGN, which have harder spectra and centrally\nconcentrated distribution. These results are supportive of the assumption of\nthe merger shock acceleration of electrons in clusters. Assuming that the\nCosmic Microwave Background photons experience Inverse Compton scattering from\nthe merger-accelerated relativistic electrons, and thus produce the observed\nHXR, the measured hard X-ray slope corresponds to a differential momentum\nspectra of the relativistic electrons with a slope of mu = 3.8-5.0. The\nobserved slope of HXR is also consistent with that predicted by the non-thermal\nbremsstrahlung, which thus cannot be ruled by the fit to the current data, even\nthough this model requires an extreme, untenable cluster energetics. Assuming\ncentrally concentrated distribution of HXR, the data requires a harder slope\nfor the HXR spectrum, which is consistent with secondary electron models, but\nthis model yields a worse fit to the PDS data and thus seems to be disfavored\nover the primary electron Inverse Compton model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Nov 2003 01:25:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The three alternative\nthemes are spin torsion (or Einstein-Cartan-Kibble-Sciama) theories, extra\ndimensions (braneworld cosmology) and changing global symmetry. In the spin\ntorsion theories, we found new cosmological solutions with a cosmological\nconstant as alternative to the standard scalar field driven inflationary\nscenario and we conclude that these toy models do not exhibit an inflationary\nphase. In the theme of extra dimensions, we discuss the dynamics of linearized\nscalar and tensor perturbations in an almost Friedmann-Robertson-Walker\nbraneworld cosmology of Randall-Sundrum type II using the 1+3 covariant\napproach. We derive a complete set of frame-independent equations for the total\nmatter variables, and a partial set of equations for the non-local variables,\nwhich arise from the projection of the Weyl tensor in the bulk. The latter\nequations are incomplete since there is no propagation equation for the\nnon-local anisotropic stress. In the simplest approximation, we show the\nbraneworld imprint as a correction to the power spectra for standard\ntemperature and polarization anisotropies and similarly show that the tensor\nanisotropies are also insensitive to the high energy effects.

It predicted that the\ncurvature in A-tract repeats can be relaxed by introducing single stranded\nbreaks (nicks). This effect has not been tested earlier and it would not be\naccounted for by alternative models of DNA bending. Here the curvature in a\nspecifically designed series of nicked DNA fragments is tested experimentally\nby gel mobility assays and, simultaneously, by free molecular dynamics\nsimulations. Single stranded breaks produce virtually no effect upon the gel\nmobility of the random sequence DNA. In contrast, nicked A-tract fragments\nreveal a regular modulation of curvature depending upon the position of the\nstrand break with respect to the overall bend. Maximal relaxation is observed\nwhen nicks occur inside A-tracts. The results are partially reproduced in\nsimulations. Analysis of computed curved DNA conformations reveals a group of\nsugar atoms that exhibit reduced backbone length within A-tracts, which can\ncorrespond to the compression hypothesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Nov 2003 15:08:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
