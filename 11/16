This work confirms the proposal of\nNavarro, Frenk & White (NFW) that the shape of LambdaCDM halo mass profiles\ndiffers strongly from a power law and is approximately independent of mass. The\nlogarithmic slope of the spherically-averaged density profile, as measured by\nbeta=-dln(rho)/dlnr, decreases monotonically towards the center, becomes\nshallower than isothermal (beta<2) inside a characteristic radius, r_{-2}, and\nshows no evidence for convergence to a well-defined asymptotic value (beta_0)\nat the center. The dark mass contained within the innermost radius resolved by\nthe simulations places strong constraints on beta_0; cusps as steep as r^{-1.5}\nare clearly ruled out in our highest resolution simulations. A profile where\nthe radial dependence of the slope is a simple power law, beta(r)\\propto\nr^{\\alpha}, approximates the structure of halos better than the NFW profile and\nso may minimize errors when extrapolating our results inward to radii not yet\nreliably probed by numerical simulations. We compare the spherically-averaged\ncircular velocity (V_c) profiles to the rotation curves of low surface\nbrightness (LSB) galaxies in the samples of de Blok et al and Swaters et al.\nThe V_c profiles of simulated CDM halos are generally consistent with the\nrotation curves of LSB galaxies, but there are also some clearly discrepant\ncases. This disagreement has been interpreted as excluding the presence of\ncusps, but it may also just reflect the difference between circular velocity\nand rotation speed likely to arise in gaseous disks embedded within realistic\ntriaxial halos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Nov 2003 00:50:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Thus we obtain a set of the\nWitten indexes for $K$. Our Witten indexes are topological invariants for\n$n$-dimensional knots. Our Witten indexes are not zero in general. If $K$ is\nequivalent to the trivial knot, all of our Witten indexes are zero. Our Witten\nindexes restrict the Alexander polynomials of $n$-knots. If one of our Witten\nindexes for an $n$-knot $K$ is nonzero, then one of the Alexander polynomials\nof $K$ is nontrivial. Our Witten indexes are connected with homology with\ntwisted coefficients. Roughly speaking, our Witten indexes have path integral\nrepresentation by using a usual manner of supersymmetric theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Nov 2003 10:51:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

In\nfact, we show that the Lichnerowicz Laplacian, which governs the second\nvariation, is the square of a twisted Dirac operator. Our second result, which\nis a local version of the first one, shows that any metrics of positive scalar\ncurvature cannot lie too close to a metric with nonzero parallel spinor. We\nalso prove a rigidity result for special holonomy metrics. In the case of\n$SU(m)$ holonomy, the rigidity result implies that scalar flat deformations of\nCalabi-Yau metric must be Calabi-Yau.
