The first one, proposed recently by Taraskin et al, is a\ntranslationally invariant system, built out of two independent non-overlapping\nbands of single-particle orbitals that are coupled by a weak inter-band\nhybridization. This kind of insulator exhibits unphysical properties: we show,\nin particular, that the one-body density matrix does not depend on the width of\nthe gap between the bands. Consequently, there is no delocalization effect with\nincreasing metallicity. In the second model there are also two bands. However,\nthey are not imposed by construction but are created from a band of\nsingle-particle orbitals due to the breaking of the translational symmetry by a\nperiodic potential. These bands are separated by a gap for all nonzero values\nof the unique energy parameter of the model. We demonstrate that the one-body\ndensity matrix has the same structure as in the first model. As a result, the\nlarge distance asymptotic formulae derived by Taraskin et al in dimensions\n$D=1,2,3$, apply as well, but only for very large gap widths. In D=1 and in the\ndiagonal direction of D=2 cases, we derive a stronger asymptotic formula, valid\nfor all gap widths. The both kinds of asymptotic formulae are composed of a\ndimension-dependent power-law factor and a gap-dependent exponentially decaying\nfactor. The latter asymptotics implies that the exponential decay rate vanishes\nlinearly with the vanishing gap. In non-diagonal directions, we have found\nnumerically that the linear scaling is replaced by the square root one.\nIndependently of the direction, the exponential decay rate grows\nlogarithmically with the gap width, for sufficiently large gaps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Nov 2003 11:50:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Our hypothesis is that non-wellfounded sets\n(hypersets) give rise to a different quality of virtual reality than do\nfamiliar wellfounded sets. We initially provide an alternative approach to\nvirtual reality based on Sommerhoff's idea of first and second order\nself-awareness; both categories of self-awareness are considered as necessary\nconditions for consciousness in terms of higher cognitive functions. We then\nintroduce a representation of first and second order self-awareness through\nsets, and assume that these sets, which we call events, originally form a\ncollection of wellfounded sets. Strong virtual reality characterizes virtual\nreality environments which have the limited capacity to create only events\nassociated with wellfounded sets. In contrast, the more general concept of weak\nvirtual reality characterizes collections of virtual reality mediated events\naltogether forming an entirety larger than any collection of wellfounded sets.\nBy giving reference to Aczel's hyperset theory we indicate that this definition\nis not empty, because hypersets encompass wellfounded sets already. Moreover,\nwe argue that weak virtual reality could be realized in human history through\ncontinued progress in computer technology. Finally, we reformulate our\ncharacterization into a more general framework, and use Baltag's Structural\nTheory of Sets (STS) to show that within this general hyperset theory\nSommerhoff's first and second order self-awareness as well as both concepts of\nvirtual reality admit a consistent mathematical representation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Nov 2003 14:08:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2006 20:21:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2006 22:38:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
