This happens because the transverse spatial distribution of hard\npartons (x >~ 10^{-2}) in the proton is considerably narrower than that of soft\npartons, whose collisions dominate the total cross section.

A discrete group\n$G$ is said to have the $\\sigma$-multiplier algebraic eigenvalue property, if\nfor every matrix $A$ with entries in the twisted group ring over the complex\nalgebraic numbers $M_d(\\Qbar(G,\\sigma))$, regarded as an operator on\n$l^2(G)^d$, the eigenvalues of $A$ are algebraic numbers, where $\\sigma$ is an\nalgebraic multiplier. Such operators include the Harper operator and the\ndiscrete magnetic Laplacian that occur in solid state physics. We prove that\nany finitely generated amenable, free or surface group has this property for\nany algebraic multiplier $\\sigma$. In the special case when $\\sigma$ is\nrational ($\\sigma^n$=1 for some positive integer $n$) this property holds for a\nlarger class of groups, containing free groups and amenable groups, and closed\nunder taking directed unions and extensions with amenable quotients. Included\nin the paper are proofs of other spectral properties of such operators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Nov 2003 18:21:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 Jun 2005 08:56:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
