Our analysis confirms the proposal of Navarro, Frenk & White\n(NFW) that the shape of LambdaCDM halo mass profiles differs strongly from a\npower law and depends little on mass. The logarithmic slope of the\nspherically-averaged density profile, as measured by beta=-dln(rho)/dln(r),\ndecreases monotonically towards the center and becomes shallower than\nisothermal (beta<2) inside a characteristic radius, r_{-2}. Although the\nfitting formula proposed by NFW provides a reasonably good approximation to the\ndensity and circular velocity profiles of individual halos, systematic\ndeviations from the best NFW fits are also noticeable. Inside r_{-2}, the\nprofile of simulated halos gets shallower with radius more gradually than\npredicted and, as a result, NFW fits tend to underestimate the dark matter\ndensity in these regions. This discrepancy has been interpreted as indicating a\nsteeply divergent cusp, but our results suggest a different interpretation. We\nuse the density and enclosed mass at our innermost resolved radii to place\nstrong constraints on beta_{0}: density cusps as steep as r^{-1.5} are\ninconsistent with most of our simulations, although beta_{0}=1 is still\nconsistent with our data. Our density profiles show no sign of converging to a\nwell-defined asymptotic inner power law. We propose a simple formula that\nreproduces the radial dependence of the slope better than the NFW profile, and\nso may minimize errors when extrapolating our results inward to radii not yet\nreliably probed by numerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Nov 2003 19:33:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Jan 2004 22:46:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We\nfind that at any cosmic epoch the voids have a size distribution which is\nwell-peaked about a characteristic void size which evolves self-similarly in\ntime. This is in distinct contrast to the distribution of virialized halo\nmasses which does not have a small-scale cut-off.\n  In our model, the fate of voids is ruled by two processes. The first process\naffects those voids which are embedded in larger underdense regions: the\nevolution is effectively one in which a larger void is made up by the mergers\nof smaller voids, and is analogous to how massive clusters form from the\nmergers of less massive progenitors. The second process is unique to voids, and\noccurs to voids which happen to be embedded within a larger scale overdensity:\nthese voids get squeezed out of existence as the overdensity collapses around\nthem. It is this second process which produces the cut-off at small scales.\n  In the excursion set formulation of cluster abundance and evolution, solution\nof the cloud-in-cloud problem, i.e., counting as clusters only those objects\nwhich are not embedded in larger clusters, requires study of random walks\ncrossing one barrier. We show that a similar formulation of void evolution\nrequires study of a two-barrier problem: one barrier is required to account for\nvoids-in-voids, and the other for voids-in-clouds.

Our motive is to determine\nwhether or not line-driven disk winds can account for the wide/broad UV\nresonance absorption lines seen in cataclysmic variables (CVs) and\nquasi-stellar objects (QSOs). In both CVs and QSOs observations generally\nindicate that the absorption arising in the outflowing winds has a steady\nvelocity structure on time scales exceeding years (for CVs) and decades (for\nQSOs). However, published results from hydrodynamic simulations of line-driven\ndisk winds are mixed, with some researchers claiming that the models are\ninherently unsteady, while other models produce steady winds. The analytic\ninvestigation presented here shows that if the accretion disk is steady, then\nthe line-driven disk wind emanating from it can also be steady. In particular,\nwe show that a gravitational force initially increasing along the wind\nstreamline, which is characteristic of disk winds, does not imply an unsteady\nwind. The steady nature of line-driven disk winds is consistent with the 1D\nstreamline disk-wind models of Murray and collaborators and the 2.5D\ntime-dependent models of Pereyra and collaborators. This paper emphasizes the\nunderlying physics behind the steady nature of line-driven disk winds using\nmathematically simple models that mimic the disk environment\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Nov 2003 23:39:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-12"}

A revision of these\nconcepts started in the beginning of the XX century in connection with the\ninvestigation of non-stoichiometric compounds (the berthollides) but did not\nreach a critical level until recently. Most of the HTSC materials, however, are\nactually non-stoichiometric nanocomposites, whose components \"dilute\" or\n\"stretch\" one another. Each component resides in an \"intermediate\" state, which\nstill remains poorly studied. For instance, in a system of particles having two\npaired electrons each, the unbroken electron pairs may start tunneling at a\ncertain \"medium\" concentration with the system becoming a Bose superconductor\n(the state between the insulator and the metal with BCS superconductivity). For\nunivalent atoms (Na,Ag), however, such possibility realizes neither in\nintermediate nor in the final state. Univalent metals are not superconductors.\nIn the berthollides, however, a possible Jahn-Teller-Peierls-type instability\nmay give rise to formation of diatomic molecules (Na2, Ag2)with electron pairs,\nand superconductivity can set in. It is possibly such systems that were\nobtained by chance in experiments with univalent components and reported to\nhave Tc of up to 371 K. Structures of a number of HTSC materials are\nconsidered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Nov 2003 11:02:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Nov 2003 10:27:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Stochastic reconnection is a generic effect, due to field line\nwandering, in which the speed of reconnection is determined by the ability of\nejected plasma to diffuse away from the current sheet along magnetic field\nlines, rather than by the details of current sheet structure. We consider the\nlimit of weak stochasticity, so that the mean magnetic field energy density is\ngreater than either the turbulent kinetic energy density or the energy density\nassociated with the fluctuating component of the field. We consider field line\nstochasticity generated through a turbulent cascade, which leads us to consider\nthe effect of neutral drag on the turbulent cascade of energy. In a\ncollisionless plasma, neutral particle viscosity and ion-neutral drag will damp\nmid-scale turbulent motions, but the power spectrum of the magnetic\nperturbations extends below the viscous cutoff scale. We give a simple physical\npicture of the magnetic field structure below this cutoff, consistent with\nnumerical experiments. We provide arguments for the reemergence of the\nturbulent cascade well below the viscous cut-off scale and derive estimates for\nfield line diffusion on all scales. We note that this explains the persistence\nof a single power law form for the turbulent power spectrum of the interstellar\nmedium, from scales of tens of parsecs down to thousands of kilometers. We find\nthat under typical conditions in the ISM stochastic reconnection speeds are\nreduced by the presence of neutrals, but by no more than an order of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Nov 2003 16:12:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The\nsub-probability measures allow a certain probability for the non-termination of\nthe computation.
