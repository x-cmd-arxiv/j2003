A significant anti-correlation is found\nbetween these two quantities in the sense that the excess variance decreases\nwith increasing black hole mass. This anti-correlation is consistent with the\nhypothesis that the 2-10 keV power spectrum in AGN follows a power law of slope\n-2 at high frequencies. It then flattens to a slope of -1 below a break\nfrequency until a second break frequency below which it flattens to a slope of\nzero. The ratio of the two break frequencies is equal to 10-30, similar to the\nratio of the respective frequencies in Cyg X-1. The power spectrum amplitude in\nthe \"frequency x power\" space does not depend on black hole mass. Instead it is\nroughly equal to 0.02 in all objects. The high frequency break decreases with\nincreasing black hole mass according to the relation 1.5x(10^-6)/(BHmass/(10^7)\nsolar masses) Hz, in the case of \"classical\" Seyfert 1 galaxies. The excess\nvariance of NGC4051, a Narrow Line Seyfert 1 object, is larger than what is\nexpected for its black hole mass and X-ray luminosity. This can be explained if\nits high frequency break is 20 times larger than the value expected in the case\nof a \"classical\" Seyfert 1 with the same black hole mass. Finally, the excess\nvariance vs X-ray luminosity correlation is a byproduct of the excess variance\nvs black hole mass correlation, with AGN accreting at ~ 0.1-0.15 the Eddington\nlimit. These results are consistent with recent results from the power spectral\nanalysis of AGN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Nov 2003 13:45:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
