High quality FUSE data of Mrk 279 are used to\ndemonstrate that the line of sight covering fraction is a strong function of\nvelocity. In Mrk 279, as well as in most cases where the data is of high enough\nquality, the shape of the absorption troughs is mainly determined by the\nvelocity-dependent covering fraction. We argue that the traditional ``cloud''\npicture of AGN outflows is hard pressed to account for the velocity-dependent\ncovering fraction, as well as for the highly super-thermal width of the troughs\nand the detached trough phenomenon. A disk outflow picture naturally explains\nthese features and furthermore, is using the simplest reservoir for the\noutflowing material: The accretion disk around the black hole. Accounting for\nvelocity dependent covering can drastically increase the inferred ionic column\ndensity of the analyzed trough, an increase which is amplified in the total\ncolumn density and ionization parameter solution for the AGN outflow trough.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Nov 2003 23:46:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

The bulge dominated galaxies (E/S0) on the other hand appear a\nsignificant 0.35 mag bluer in (V-K) than their inactive counterparts, being as\nblue as the discs in the sample. This trend is confirmed by fitting population\nsynthesis models to the extracted broad band SEDs: the stellar population age\nof the bulge dominated hosts lies around a few Gyr, much younger than expected\nfor old evolved ellipticals. Comparison to other studies suggests a strong\ntrend for stellar age in elliptical host galaxies with luminosity.\nIntermediately luminous elliptical hosts have comparably young populations,\neither intrinsically or from an enhanced star formation rate potentially due to\ninteraction, the most luminous and massive ellipticals on the contrary show old\npopulations. The correspondence between the nuclear activity and the blue\ncolours suggests a connection between galaxy interaction, induced star\nformation and the triggering of nuclear activity. However, the existence of\nvery symmetric and undisturbed disks and elliptical host galaxies emphasised\nthat other mechanisms like minor merging or gas accretion must exist.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Nov 2003 15:04:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

According to our analysis, these four bubbles have developed with\nessentially no significant increase of their volatility. This paper thus\nproposes that speculative bubbles ending in crashes form two groups hitherto\nunrecognized, namely those accompanied by increasing volatility (reflecting\nincreasing risk perception) and those without change of volatility (reflecting\nan absence of risk perception).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Nov 2003 04:11:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The primary of these are the free Appell\npolynomials. In the multivariate case, they can be considered as natural\nanalogs of the Appell polynomials among polynomials in non-commuting variables.\nThey also fit well into the framework of free probability. For the free Appell\npolynomials, a number of combinatorial and \"diagram\" formulas are proven, such\nas the formulas for their linearization coefficients. An explicit formula for\ntheir generating function is obtained. These polynomials are also martingales\nfor free Levy processes. For more general free Sheffer families, a necessary\ncondition for pseudo-orthogonality is given. Another family investigated are\nthe Kailath-Segall polynomials. These are multivariate polynomials, which share\nwith the Appell polynomials nice combinatorial properties, but are always\northogonal. Their origins lie in the Fock space representations, or in the\ntheory of multiple stochastic integrals. Diagram formulas are proven for these\npolynomials as well, even in the q-deformed case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Nov 2003 19:30:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 May 2004 01:05:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 2004 02:30:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Here a^x stands for xax^{-1}. The computational\ndifficulty of this problem in some particular groups has been used in several\ngroup based cryptosystems. Recently, a few preprints have been in circulation\nthat suggested various \"neighbourhood search\" type heuristic attacks on the\nconjugacy search problem. The goal of the present survey is to stress a\n(probably well known) fact that these heuristic attacks alone are not a threat\nto the security of a cryptosystem, and, more importantly, to suggest a more\ncredible approach to assessing security of group based cryptosystems. Such an\napproach should be necessarily based on the concept of the average case\ncomplexity (or expected running time) of an algorithm.\n  These arguments support the following conclusion: although it is generally\nfeasible to base the security of a cryptosystem on the difficulty of the\nconjugacy search problem, the group G itself (the \"platform\") has to be chosen\nvery carefully. In particular, experimental as well as theoretical evidence\ncollected so far makes it appear likely that braid groups are not a good choice\nfor the platform.
