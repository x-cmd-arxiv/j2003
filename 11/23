This thesis describes how the Nahm\ntransform can be extended to the case of calorons. It is shown how calorons can\nbe constructed from Nahm data similar to that for monopoles, but defined over\nthe circle. The inverse transformation, from the caloron to the Nahm data, is\nalso described.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Nov 2003 18:18:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}
