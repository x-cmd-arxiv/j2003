It is suggested that both objects are the remnants of a\nsupernova (SN) that exploded within a pre-existing bubble blown-up by a runaway\nmassive star (the SN progenitor) during the final (Wolf-Rayet) phase of its\nevolution. This suggestion implies that (a) the SN blast centre was\nsignificantly offset from the geometric centre of the wind-blown bubble (i.e.\nfrom the centre of the future SNR), (b) the bubble was surrounded by a massive\nwind-driven shell, and (c) the SN blast wave was drastically decelerated by the\ninteraction with the shell. Therefore, one can understand how the relatively\nyoung and low-velocity pulsar PSR B1757-24 was able to escape from the\nassociated SNR G5.4-1.2 and why the inferred vector of pulsar transverse\nvelocity does not point away from the geometric centre of the SNR. A possible\norigin of the radio source G5.27-0.9 (located between PSR B1757-24 and the SNR\nG5.4-1.2) is proposed.

In order\nfor the beams/jets associated with gamma-ray bursts to form in mergers within\nmassive common envelopes (as with SN 1987A), much of the intervening stellar\nmaterial in the polar directions must be cleared out by the time of\ncore-collapse, or the beams/jets themselves must clear their own path.

Using\nanother IMF, even a top-heavy one, does not alter our conclusions. The high\nvalue of M_(bar,max) observed at z > 4 implies that massive clouds were already\nformed at early epochs.

This paper investigates a strategy for energy efficient\nmonitoring in WSNs that partitions the sensors into covers, and then activates\nthe covers iteratively in a round-robin fashion. This approach takes advantage\nof the overlap created when many sensors monitor a single area. Our work builds\nupon previous work in \"Power Efficient Organization of Wireless Sensor\nNetworks\" by Slijepcevic and Potkonjak, where the model is first formulated. We\nhave designed three approximation algorithms for a variation of the SET K-COVER\nproblem, where the objective is to partition the sensors into covers such that\nthe number of covers that include an area, summed over all areas, is maximized.\nThe first algorithm is randomized and partitions the sensors, in expectation,\nwithin a fraction 1 - 1/e (~.63) of the optimum. We present two other\ndeterministic approximation algorithms. One is a distributed greedy algorithm\nwith a 1/2 approximation ratio and the other is a centralized greedy algorithm\nwith a 1 - 1/e approximation ratio. We show that it is NP-Complete to guarantee\nbetter than 15/16 of the optimal coverage, indicating that all three algorithms\nperform well with respect to the best approximation algorithm possible.\nSimulations indicate that in practice, the deterministic algorithms perform far\nabove their worst case bounds, consistently covering more than 72% of what is\ncovered by an optimum solution. Simulations also indicate that the increase in\nlongevity is proportional to the amount of overlap amongst the sensors. The\nalgorithms are fast, easy to use, and according to simulations, significantly\nincrease the longevity of sensor networks. The randomized algorithm in\nparticular seems quite practical.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Nov 2003 22:47:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
