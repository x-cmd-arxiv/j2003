As an example, perylene in solid and liquid n-alkane matrices was\nchosen, and all shifts are calculated relative to one well-defined\nsolid-inclusion system. It is shown that a simple two-level treatment of the\nsolute using Huckel theory yields spectral shifts in excellent agreement with\nexperimental results for the most prominent inclusion sites of perylene in\nsolid n-alkane surroundings and for the dilute solutions in liquid n-alkanes.\nThe idea is general enough to be applied to any aromatic chromophore in a\nnonpolar solvent matrix. In contrast to earlier treatments, this approach is\nbased on geometry-dependent polarizabilities, employs a r^-4 dependence for the\ndispersion energy, is conceptually simple and computationally efficient.\nDifferent simple models based on our general approach to compute the UV\nspectral shifts due to solvation indicate that the dispersive part of the\nvan-der-Waals energy, which stabilizes the LUMO of perylene more than the HOMO,\nfalls off with a distance dependence of r^-4 in a range up to ~1 nm and not as\nr^-6, as has been assumed for a long time.
