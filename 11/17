The\ncollapse starts from the center, and propagates outwards in an inside-out\nfashion, satisfying exact self-similarity in space and time. For rotation rates\nand field strengths typical of dense low-mass cores, the main feature remains\nthe flattening of the mass distribution along field lines -- the formation of a\npseudodisk, as in the nonrotating cases.

X-ray data from\nthe ROSAT All Sky Survey were also collected in order to constrain the\nradio-to-X-ray luminosity ratio (alpha_RX) of the sources. The data analysis\nshows that more than 30% of sources at low radio power (P(5 GHz)<10^25 W Hz^-1)\nhave an alpha_RX steeper than that expected in the framework of the ``blazar\nsequence'' recently put forward to unify the high and low power blazars. The\npossibility that this result is influenced by contaminating sources in the\ncurrent sample is discussed. The conclusion is that, even if a number of\nnon-blazars (typically CSO/GPS sources) are expected in the survey, it is\nunlikely that this constitutes the sole reason for the observed deviation. In\nparticular, we show 2 examples for which the blazar nature is confirmed from\nVLBI data and for which the steep alpha_RX (suggesting a synchrotron peak\nfrequency below 10^15.5 Hz) and the low radio power (0.6-2x10^24 W Hz^-1) put\nthese sources outside the ``blazar sequence''. The results presented here show\nthe importance of a correct and unbiased sampling of the low-power regime of\nthe blazar population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Nov 2003 14:29:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

This paper\naddresses two questions: (1) under what conditions may several gradient paths\nin a discrete Morse function simultaneously be reversed to cancel several pairs\nof critical cells, to further collapse the complex, and (2) how to use\nlexicographically first reduced expressions for permutations (in the sense of\n[Ed]) to make (1) practical for poset order complexes.\n  Applications include Cohen-Macaulayness of a new partial order, recently\nintroduced by Remmel, on the symmetric group (by refinement on the underlying\npartitions into cycles) as well as a simple new proof of the homotopy type for\nintervals in the weak order for the symmetric group. Additional applications\nappear in [HW].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Nov 2003 17:48:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Aug 2018 12:39:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-24"}
