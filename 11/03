We ``observe'' and analyze our\nmodels in much the same way as observers do the real galaxies. We find that the\ntilted ring model analysis produces an underestimate of the central rotational\nvelocity. In some cases the galaxy halo density profile seems to have a flat\ncore, while in reality it does not. We identify three effects, which explain\nthe systematic biases: (1) inclination (2), small bulge, and (3) bar. The\npresence of even a small non-rotating bulge component reduces the rotation\nvelocity. In the case of a disk with a bar, the underestimate of the circular\nvelocity is larger due to a combination of non-circular motions and random\nvelocities. Signatures of bars can be difficult to detect in the surface\nbrightness profiles of the model galaxies. The variation of inclination angle\nand isophote position angle with radius are more reliable indicators of bar\npresence than the surface brightness profiles. The systematic biases in the\ncentral ~ 1 kpc of galaxies are not large. Each effect separately gives\ntypically a few kms error, but the effects add up. In some cases the error in\ncircular velocity was a factor of two, but typically we get about 20 percent.\nThe result is the false inference that the density profile of the halo flattens\nin the central parts. Our observations of real galaxies show that for a large\nfraction of galaxies the velocity of gas rotation (as measured by emission\nlines) is very close to the rotation of stellar component (as measured by\nabsorption lines).

We propose an explicit\nphysical model for disc variability, consistent with Lyubarskii's (1997)\ngeneral scheme for solving this problem. We suggest that local dynamo processes\ncan affect the evolution of an accretion disc by driving angular momentum loss\nin the form of an outflow (a wind or jet). We model the dynamo as a small-scale\nstochastic phenomenon, operating on roughly the local dynamical timescale. We\nargue that large-scale outflow can only occur when the small-scale random\nprocesses in neighbouring disc annuli give rise by chance to a coherent\nlarge-scale magnetic field. This occurs on much longer timescales, and causes a\nbright large-amplitude flare as a wide range of disc radii evolve in a coherent\nfashion. Most of the time, dynamo action instead produces small-amplitude\nflickering. We reproduce power spectra similar to those observed, including a\n1/f power spectrum below a break frequency given by the magnetic alignment\ntimescale at the inner disc edge. However the relation between the black hole\nmass and the value of the break frequency is less straightforward than often\nassumed in the literature. The effect of an outer disc edge is to flatten the\nspectrum below the magnetic alignment frequency there.

The aspect of\nso-called ``double special relativity'' (DSR) is a starting point in our\ndiscussion. The three elementary ideas were involved to show that special\nrelativity may be treated as an integral part of quantum mechanics. These ideas\n(or observations) are: (1) the necessity of distinguishing the two time\nmeanings, namely: (i) the vital one referring to description of system\nevolution, and (ii) the frozen one, referring to energy measure by means of\ninverse time units; (2) the existence of the energy-momentum (and\ntime-distance) comparison scale in relativistic description; and (3) a\npossibility of introduction of mass by means of a light-cone frame description.\nThe resulting quantum-mechanical analysis allows us to find diagonal form of\nthe Lorentz-boost transformation matrix and thus to relate the interval\ninvariant relativity principle with the principles of quantum mechanics. The\nmanner, in which the diagonal form of the transformation matrix was found,\nshows that covariant description itself is a preferred frame description and\nthat the time that undergoes relativistic transformation rules is the frozen\ntime, whereas the vital time is the Lorentz invariant. A generalized form of\nthe Heisenberg uncertainty principle proposed by Witten (Phys. Today, Apriel\n1996), is derived. It turns out, that this form is equivalent to the one know\nfrom the analysis of the covariant harmonic oscillator given by Kim and Noz\n(the book, 1986). As a by-product of this analysis one finds that special\nrelativity itself preserves the Planck length, however, a particle cannot be\nseen any longer as a material point, but rather as an extended quantum object.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Nov 2003 14:05:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 14 Aug 2004 20:22:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In a diploid organism, each gene\nexists in two copies and when one of these is mutated, the amount of proteins\nsynthesized is reduced and may fall below a threshold level for the onset of\nsome desired activity. This can give rise to HI, a manifestation of which is in\nthe form of a disease. We consider both deterministic and stochastic models of\ngene expression and suggest possible scenarios for the occurrence of HI in the\ntwo cases. In the stochastic case, random fluctuations around the mean protein\nlevel give rise to a finite probability that the protein level falls below a\nthreshold. Increased gene copy number and faster gene expression kinetics\nreduce the variance around the mean protein level. The difference between slow\nand fast gene expression kinetics, as regards response to a signaling gradient,\nis further pointed out.
