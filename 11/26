The 3PCF amplitudes [$\\Qsu$ or $\\Qrpu$] of the galaxies\ngenerally decrease with increasing triangle size and increase with the shape\nparameter $v$, in qualitative agreement with the predictions for the clustering\nof dark matter in popular hierarchical CDM models. The 2dFGRS results agree\nwell with the results of Jing & B\\\"orner for the Las Camapanas Redshift Survey\n(LCRS), though the measurement accuracy is greatly improved in the present\nstudy. The dependence of the 3PCF on luminosity is not significant, but there\nseems to be a trend for the brightest galaxy sample to have a lower amplitude\nthan the fainter ones. Comparing the measured 3PCF amplitudes [$\\Qsu$ or\n$\\Qrpu$] to the prediction of a WMAP concordance model, we find that the\nmeasured values are consistently lower than the predicted ones for dark matter.\nThis is most pronounced for the brightest galaxies, for which about one-half of\nthe predicted $Q$ value provides a good description of $\\Qrpu$ for the 2dFGRS\ndata.

The dynamical evolutions of the entanglement and\nentropy, are controlled via time-dependent cavity-atom couplings.
