This coupling modifies substantially both\nthe dynamics of rotational and translational motions by inducing grain flips.\nThe flipping averages our certain systematic torques and forces that act on\ngrains. As the rate of flipping is larger for smaller grains, these grains can\nbe ``thermally trapped'', i.e. rotate at a thermal rate in spite of the\npresence of systematic torques. Moreover, a subset of small grains with high\ndipole moments may rotate at subthermal rates due to high damping arising from\ngrain emission in microwave range of frequencies. Translational dynamics of\ngrains is mostly dominated by grain interactions with magnetohydrodynamic\nturbulence. Efficient turbulent mixing of dust grains limits the degree to\nwhich grains of different sizes may be segregated in space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Nov 2003 16:33:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The sheet\ngeometry allows us to separate the magnetic tension into a levitation\nassociated with the split monopole formed by the trapped flux of the central\nstar and a suspension associated with curved field lines that thread the static\npseudodisk and envelope of material external to the star.

We imagine a history where initial quantum\nfluctuations give an energy density $\\sim m_{susy}^2m_{Pl}^2$, but the universe\nquickly cascades to an energy density $\\sim m_{susy}^2m_{Pl}^2/N$. Then at\nvarious phase transitions there are large contributions to the energy density\nand rearrangement of levels, followed again by a rapid cascade to the ground\nstate or near it. If this mechanism is correct, the ground state of the theory\ndescribing our world would be a superposition of a large number of connected\nstring vacua,with shared superselection sets of properties such as three\nfamilies etc. The observed value of the cosmological constant in terms of the\nPlanck mass, the scale of supersymmetry breaking and the number of connected\nstring vacua.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Nov 2003 22:27:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Extending into the\nrelativistic regime for spinless particles, this procedure leads also to a\nderivation of the Klein-Gordon equation. Comparing classical Hamiltonian flow\nwith quantum theory, then, the essential difference is given by a vanishing\ndivergence of the velocity of the probability current in the former, whereas\nthe latter results from a much less stringent requirement, i.e., that only the\naverage over fluctuations and positions of the average divergence be identical\nto zero.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Nov 2003 17:13:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Feb 2004 19:42:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The present paper\nexplains the reason why the walker who moves according to the degree-four\nGrover's operator can remain at the starting point with a high probability. It\nis shown that the key factor for the localization is due to the degeneration of\neigenvalues of the time evolution operator.
