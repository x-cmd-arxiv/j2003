We present models for the afterglows of GRB\n020405 and GRB 021211, which are a challenge to wind interaction models.\nConsidering sources for which wind interaction models are acceptable, a range\nof wind densities is required, from values typical of Galactic Wolf-Rayet stars\nto values ~100 times smaller.

The\ninterpretation of bursts apparently interacting with constant density media as\ninteraction with a shocked wind requires both a range of mass loss densities\nand a range of external pressures. The highest pressures, p/k > 10^8 cm^{-3} K,\nmay be due to an extreme starburst environment, which would imply that the\nburst is superposed on an active star forming region.

With reference to the concept of transient networks, constitutive\nequations are developed for the viscoelastic response of polymer melts at\nthree-dimensional deformations with small strains. A melt is treated as an\nequivalent network of strands bridged by temporary junctions (entanglements and\nphysical cross-links whose life-times exceed the characteristic time of\ndeformation). The time-dependent behavior of the network is modelled as\ndetachment of active strands from their junctions and merging of dangling\nstrands with the network. The network is assumed to be strongly heterogeneous\nin the sense that different junctions have different activation energies for\nseparation of strands. The stress-strain relations involve three adjustable\nparameters (the plateau modulus, the average activation energy for\nrearrangement of strands and the standard deviation of activation energies)\nthat are determined by matching the dependencies of storage and loss moduli on\nfrequency of oscillations. The difference in the effects of temperature on the\nmaterial constants of iPP and LDPE is associated with the difference in their\nmolecular architecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Nov 2003 16:15:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The new method is both more\naccurate overall (error statistics for total atomization energies approximately\ncut in half) and more robust (particularly towards systems exhibiting\nsignificant nondynamical correlation) than W2 theory. The cardinal improvement\nrests in an approximate account for post-CCSD(T) correlation effects. Iterative\nT_3 (connected triple excitations) effects exhibit a basis set convergence\nbehavior similar to the T_3 contribution overall. They almost universally\ndecrease molecular binding energies. Their inclusion in isolation yields less\naccurate results than CCSD(T) nearly across the board: it is only when T_4\n(connected quadruple excitations) effects are included that superior\nperformance is achieved. $T_4$ effects systematically increase molecular\nbinding energies. Their basis set convergence is quite rapid, and even\nCCSDTQ/cc-pVDZ scaled by an empirical factor of 1.2532 will yield a quite\npassable quadruples contribution.
