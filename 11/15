General arguments on network control, as\nwell as several recent genomic observations, indicate that regulatory gene\nnumber grows disproportionally fast with increasing genome size. We present two\nmodels for the growth of regulatory networks. Both predict that the number of\ntranscriptional regulators will scale quadratically with total gene number.\nThis appears to be in good quantitative agreement with genomic data from 89\nfully sequenced prokaryotes. Moreover, the empirical curve predicts that any\nnew non-regulatory gene will be accompanied by more than one additional\nregulator beyond a genome size of about 20,000 genes, within a factor of two of\nthe observed ceiling. Our analysis places transcriptional regulatory networks\nin the class of accelerating networks. We suggest that prokaryotic complexity\nmay have been limited throughout evolution by regulatory overhead, and\nconversely that complex eukaryotes must have bypassed this constraint by novel\nstrategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Nov 2003 09:15:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

One of its\ngreatest limitations is over long distance - secret key rates are low and the\nlongest fibre over which any key has been exchanged is currently 100 km. We\ninvestigate the quantum relay, which can increase the maximum distance at which\nquantum cryptography is possible. The relay splits the channel into sections,\nand sends a different photon across each section, increasing the signal to\nnoise ratio. The photons are linked as in teleportation, with entangled photon\npairs and Bell measurements. We show that such a scheme could allow\ncryptography over hundreds of kilometers with today's detectors. It could not,\nhowever, improve the rate of key exchange over distances where the standard\nsingle section scheme already works. We also show that reverse key\nreconciliation, previously used in continuous variable quantum cryptography,\ngives a secure key over longer distances than forward key reconciliation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Nov 2003 18:35:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-23"}
