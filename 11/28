All relevant aspects of the theory of stationary thick discs around\nrotating black holes, necessary to build the initial state in our simulations,\nare presented in great detail. The angular momentum of the discs is assumed to\nincrease outwards with the radial distance according to a power law. The main\nsimplifying assumptions of our approach are not to include magnetic fields and\nself-gravity in the discs. Furthermore, the dynamics of the spacetime is\naccounted for by computing the transfer of mass and angular momentum from the\ndisc to the black hole through the event horizon : the evolution of the central\nblack hole is assumed to follow a sequence of Kerr black holes of increasing\nmass and spin. In agreement with previous results based on stationary models we\nfind that by allowing the mass and the spin of the black hole to grow, constant\nangular momentum discs rapidly become unstable on a dynamical timescale. The\ncomparison with the results of paper I shows that the effect of the angular\nmomentum transfer from the torus to the black hole is to make constant angular\nmomentum discs less unstable, increasing the timescale of the instability.\nHowever, we find that non-constant angular momentum discs are dramatically\nstabilized for very small values of the angular momentum slope.

The local BH mass\nfunction (BHMF) is estimated by applying the well-known correlations between BH\nmass, bulge luminosity and stellar velocity dispersion to galaxy luminosity and\nvelocity functions. The density of BH's in the local universe is 4.6 (-1.4;\n+1.9) (h/0.7)^2 10^5 Msun Mpc^-3. The relic BHMF is derived from the continuity\nequation with the only assumption that AGN activity is due to accretion onto\nmassive BH's and that merging is not important. We find that the relic BHMF at\nz=0 is generated mainly at z<3. Moreover, the BH growth is anti-hierarchical in\nthe sense that smaller BH's (MBH< 10^7 Msun) grow at lower redshifts (z<1) with\nrespect to more massive one's (z~1-3). Unlike previous work, we find that the\nBHMF of AGN relics is perfectly consistent with the local BHMF indicating the\nlocal BH's were mainly grown during AGN activity. This agreement is obtained\nwhile satisfying, at the same time, the constraints imposed from the X-ray\nbackground. The comparison with the local BHMF also suggests that the merging\nprocess is not important in shaping the relic BHMF, at least at low redshifts\n(z<3). Our analysis thus suggests the following scenario: local black holes\ngrew during AGN phases in which accreting matter was converted into radiation\nwith efficiencies epsilon = 0.04-0.16 and emitted at a fraction lambda =\n0.1-1.7 of the Eddington luminosity.

Our analysis\nignores systematic effects in the data and concentrates on some key theoretical\nissues. The first data set consists of 194 points while the second discards\nsome of the points from the first one because of large uncertainties and thus\nconsists of 142 points. The third data set is obtained from the second by\nadding the latest 14 points observed through HST. A careful comparison of these\ndifferent data sets help us to draw the following conclusions: (i) All the data\nsets strongly rule out non-accelerating models. Interestingly, the first and\nthe second sets favour a closed universe; i.e., the probability P(Omega_{tot} >\n1) \\gtrsim 0.97. Hence these sets are in mild disagreement with the\n``concordance'' flat model. However, this disagreement is reduced\n[P(Omega_{tot} > 1) \\approx 0.9] for the third data set, which includes the\npoints observed by HST around 1 < z < 1.6. (ii) When the first data set is\ndivided into two separate subsets consisting of low (z < 0.34) and high (z >\n0.34) redshift supernova, it turns out that these two subsets, individually,\nadmit non-accelerating models. However, these models seem to be ruled out using\nonly the low redshift data for the other two data sets, which have less\nuncertainties. (iii) It is quite difficult to measure the evolution of the dark\nenergy equation of state w_X though its present value can be constrained quite\nwell. The best-fit value seems to mildly favour a dark energy component with\ncurrent equation of state w_X < -1, thus opening the possibility of existence\nof more exotic forms of matter. However, the data is still consistent with the\nthe standard cosmological constant at 99% confidence level (abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Nov 2003 14:10:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Dec 2003 15:35:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2004 13:39:48 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 18 Sep 2004 13:52:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

It is demonstrated\nthat gradual variations in magnitude of the grating amplitude may change the\npattern of EAS noticeably but not radically. On the other hand, phase\nvariations in the grating may result in a radically new type of Bragg\nscattering - double-resonant EAS (DEAS). In this case, a combination of two\nstrong simultaneous resonances (one with respect to frequency, and another with\nrespect to the phase variation) is predicted to take place in non-uniform\narrays with a step-like phase and gradual magnitude variations of the grating\namplitude. The tolerances of EAS and DEAS to small gradual variations in the\ngrating amplitude are determined.
