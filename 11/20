Gas drag strongly affects the motion\nof small bodies leading to the decay of their eccentricities and inclinations,\nwhich are excited by the gravity of protoplanetary cores. Drag acting on larger\n($\\gtrsim 1$ km), high velocity planetesimals causes a mere reduction of their\naverage random velocity. By contrast, drag qualitatively changes the dynamics\nof smaller ($\\lesssim 0.1-1$ km), low velocity objects: (1) small planetesimals\nsediment towards the midplane of the nebula forming vertically thin subdisk;\n(2) their random velocities rapidly decay between successive passages of the\ncores and, as a result, encounters with cores typically occur at the minimum\nrelative velocity allowed by the shear in the disk. This leads to a drastic\nincrease in the accretion rate of small planetesimals by the protoplanetary\ncores, allowing cores to grow faster than expected in the simple oligarchic\npicture, provided that the population of small planetesimals contains more than\nroughly 1% of the solid mass in the nebula.

Using a rapid binary evolution\nalgorithm, that enables us to model the most complex binary systems and to\nexplore the effect of metallicity on GRB production, we draw the following\nconclusions.

Second massive stars in binaries result in enough angular momentum\n-- due to spin-orbit tidal interactions -- to form a centrifugally supported\ndisc and are thus capable of supplying a sufficient number of progenitors. This\nholds true even if only a small fraction of bursts are visible to a given\nobserver and the GRB rate is several hundred times larger than the observed\nrate.

A transition from\nan insulating to a conductive state is observed as the applied current is\nincreased. The voltage-current (U-I) characteristics are nonlinear and\nhysteretic, and saturate to a low voltage per contact (0.4 V). Our 1D\nexperiment allows us to understand phenomena (such as the \"Branly effect\")\nrelated to this conduction transition by focusing on the nature of the contacts\ninstead of the structure of the granular network. We show that this transition\ncomes from an electro-thermal coupling in the vicinity of the microcontacts\nbetween each bead - the current flowing through these contact points generates\ntheir local heating which leads to an increase of their contact areas, and thus\nenhances their conduction. This current-induced temperature rise (up to 1050\ndeg C) results in the microsoldering of the contact points (even for voltages\nas low as 0.4 V). Based on this self-regulated temperature mechanism, an\nanalytical expression for the nonlinear U-I back trajectory is derived, and is\nfound to be in very good agreement with the experiments. In addition, we can\ndetermine the microcontact temperature with no adjustable parameters. Finally,\nthe stress dependence of the resistance is found to be strongly non-hertzian\ndue to the presence of the surface films.

The low-injection theory of spin-polarized transport through MBTs\nand of a more general case of an array of magnetic {\\it p-n} junctions is\ndeveloped and illustrated on several important cases. Two main physical\nphenomena are discussed: electrical spin injection and spin control of current\namplification (magnetoamplification). It is shown that a source spin can be\ninjected from the emitter to the collector. If the base of an MBT has an\nequilibrium magnetization, the spin can be injected from the base to the\ncollector by intrinsic spin injection. The resulting spin accumulation in the\ncollector is proportional to $\\exp(qV_{be}/k_BT)$, where $q$ is the proton\ncharge, $V_{be}$ is the bias in the emitter-base junction, and $k_B T$ is the\nthermal energy. To control the electrical current through MBTs both the\nequilibrium and the nonequilibrium spin can be employed. The equilibrium spin\ncontrols the magnitude of the equilibrium electron and hole densities, thereby\ncontrolling the currents. Increasing the equilibrium spin polarization of the\nbase (emitter) increases (decreases) the current amplification. If there is a\nnonequilibrium spin in the emitter, and the base or the emitter has an\nequilibrium spin, a spin-valve effect can lead to a giant magnetoamplification\neffect, where the current amplifications for the parallel and antiparallel\norientations of the the equilibrium and nonequilibrium spins differ\nsignificantly. The theory is elucidated using qualitative analyses and is\nillustrated on an MBT example with generic materials parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Nov 2003 17:45:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

However, it is not clear what is the group structure to which these\ntransformations are associated. In this paper, we complete a program started in\nprevious articles in order to clarify this question. Using the spectral\ntheorem, we improve and generalize previous approaches and find the possible\ngroup structures underneath the 2-form gauge potential as extensions of Lie\ngroups, when its representations are assumed to act into any tensor (or spinor)\nspace with inner product.\n  We also obtain a fundamental representation where a two-form field turns out\nto be a connection on a flat Euclidean basis manifold, with a corresponding\ncanonical curvature. However, we show that these objects are not associated to\nspace-time tensors and, in particular, that a standard Yang-Mills action is not\nrelativistically invariant, except (as expected) in the Abelian case. This is\nour main result, from the physical point of view.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Nov 2003 10:23:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Written in\nthe canonical basis of the actual Bogolyubov transformation, the force takes\nthe form of an off-shell in-medium two-body matrix in the superfluid phase\nmultiplied by a BCS occupation number $2 \\rho_{m}$. This interaction is finite\nranged, non local, total-momentum dependent and density dependent. The factor\n$2 \\rho_{m}$ emerging from the recast of the gap equation provides a natural\ncut-off and makes zero-range approximations of the effective vertex meaningful.\nPerforming such an approximation, the roles of the range and of the density\ndependence of the interaction can be disentangled. The isoscalar and isovector\ndensity-dependences derived ab-initio provide the pairing force with a strong\npredictive power when extrapolated toward the drip-lines.

The excited vapor acts on\nthe probe beam as a linear dichroic amplifier, imprinting a very specific\nsignature on the detected signal. Our differential polarimeter is oriented to\nyield a null result unless the excited atoms are endowed with a chirality of\nsome kind. Ideally, only the APV (E-odd) and the calibration (E-even) signals\ncontribute to a chiral atomic response, a situation highly favourable to the\ndetection of a tiny effect. In the present work we give a thorough analysis of\npossible unwanted defects like stray transverse fields or misalignments which\nwould spoil the ideal set-up and lead to chiral systematics. A possible way to\nsuppress such effects is to perform global rotations of the experiment by\nincremental steps of 45 degrees, leaving both stray fields and misalignments\nunaltered. The conspiration of at least two defects is necessary to affect the\nE-odd polarimeter signal. The transverse nature of the defects manifests itself\nby an azimuthal cosine square modulation. The harmful systematics are those\nwhich survive the averaging over four successive configurations. They require\nthe presence of a stray transverse electric field, which can be determined and\neventually minimized by auxiliary measurements of the systematic effects,\namplified by applying a known external magnetic field. Transverse stray\nmagnetic fields must be compensated by a similar procedure. We also propose\nstatistical correlation tests as diagnoses of the aforementioned systematic\neffects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Nov 2003 11:17:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Thus we attempt to understand the\nexisting ODPs by solving a wire length minimization problem. We divide all the\nneurons into two classes: left- and right-eye dominated. We find that\nsegregation of neurons into monocular regions reduces wire length if the number\nof connections to the neurons of the same class (intraocular) differs from the\nnumber of interocular connections. The shape of the regions depends on the\nrelative fraction of neurons in the two classes. We find that if both classes\nare almost equally represented, the optimal ODP consists of interdigitating\nstripes. If one class is less numerous than the other, the optimal ODP consists\nof patches of the less abundant class surrounded by the neurons of the other\nclass. We predict that the transition from stripes to patches occurs when the\nfraction of neurons dominated by the underrepresented eye is about 40%.
