We create Lya forest spectra that\nwould be generated in the presence of such a fluctuating radiation field,\nfinding that the power spectrum of the Lya forest can be suppressed by as much\nas 15 % for modes with k=0.05-1 Mpc/h. This relatively small effect may have\nconsequences for high precision measurements of the Lya power spectrum on\nlarger scales than have yet been published. We also investigate another\nradiation field probe, the cross-correlation of quasar positions and the Lya\nforest. For both quasar lifetimes which we simulate (10^7 yr and 10^8 yr), we\nexpect to see a strong decrease in the Lya absorption close to other quasars\n(the ``foreground'' proximity effect). We then use data from the Sloan Digital\nSky Survey First Data Release to make an observational determination of this\nstatistic. We find no sign of our predicted lack of absorption, but instead\nincreased absorption close to quasars. If the bursts of radiation from quasars\nlast on average < 10^6 yr, then we would not expect to be able to see the\nforeground effect. However, the strength of the absorption itself seems to be\nindicative of rare objects, and hence much longer total times of emission per\nquasar. Variability of quasars in bursts with timescales > 10^4yr and < 10^6 yr\ncould reconcile these two facts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Oct 2003 17:41:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We define and compute the contribution of classical optical paths to\nthe Casimir force between rigid bodies. We reproduce the standard result for\nparallel plates and agree over a wide range of parameters with a recent\nnumerical treatment of the sphere and plate with Dirichlet boundary conditions.\nOur approach improves upon proximity force approximation. It can be generalized\neasily to other geometries, other boundary conditions, to the computation of\nCasimir energy densities and to many other situations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Oct 2003 20:24:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Dec 2003 17:25:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2004 16:56:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
