However, the value of tau_e provides only an\nintegral constraint on the history of reionization and, by itself, cannot be\nused to determine the nature of the sources responsible for this transition.\nHere, we show that the evolution of the ionization state of the intergalactic\nmedium at high redshifts can be measured statistically using fluctuations in 21\ncentimeter radiation from neutral hydrogen. By analogy with the mathematical\ndescription of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background, we develop a\nformalism to quantify the variations in 21 cm emission as a function of both\nfrequency and angular scale. Prior to and following reionization, fluctuations\nin the 21 cm signal are mediated by density perturbations in the distribution\nof matter. Between these epochs, pockets of gas surrounding luminous objects\nbecome ionized, producing large HII regions. These ``bubbles'' of ionized\nmaterial imprint features into the 21 cm power spectrum that make it possible\nto distinguish them from fluctuations produced by the density perturbations.\nThe variation of the power spectrum with frequency can be used to infer the\nevolution of this process. As has been emphasized previously by others, the\nabsolute 21 cm signal from neutral gas at high redshifts is undetectable owing\nto contamination by foreground sources. However, we argue that this source of\nnoise can be suppressed by comparing maps closely spaced in frequency, i.e.\nredshift, so that 21 cm fluctuations from the IGM can be measured against a\nmuch brighter, but smoothly varying (in frequency) background.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Nov 2003 16:49:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2004 15:40:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

DLA systems offer the possibilities of\nmeasuring metal abundance more accurately than faint galaxies. For example,\nrecent measurements of zinc abundance can provide good evidence for\nunderstanding the processes of metal pollution and star formation in DLA\nsystems because zinc is virtually unaffected by dust depletion. Here we focus\non this advantage for observation in order to explore the metallicity evolution\nin DLA systems at high redshifts. We can consistently show the metallicity\nevolution for reasonable models which also reproduce fundamental properties of\nlocal galaxy population. This result suggests that the chemical evolution of\nDLA systems can be consistently reconciled with the observational features of\ntypical galaxies. We also investigate other properties of DLA systems (column\ndensity distribution and mass density of cold gas), and find that star\nformation in massive galaxies should be more active than that in low-mass ones.\nThis is consistent with the results by Nagashima et al. and Cole et al. in\nwhich the star formation timescale is set by reproducing cold gas mass fraction\nin local spiral galaxies. Finally we discuss host galaxies associated with DLA\nsystems. We conclude that they primarily consist of sub-L* and/or dwarf\ngalaxies from the observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Nov 2003 09:18:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We detect a hot region\nassociated with a density jump ~450 kpc east of the cluster centre, which\nappears to be a shock wave. This shock is not connected with the binary merger,\nbut it is intrinsic to A1750 C itself.

The larger scale\nstructure around A1750 suggests that the system belongs to a rich supercluster,\nwhich would presumably increase the likelihood of merger events.

The main advantages of\nthis setup with respect to previous pressure-jump systems is that the pressure\njump is induced through a pressure transmitting fluid mechanically coupled to\nthe sample stage through a deformable membrane, thus avoiding any flow of the\nsample itself in the pressure network and allowing to deal with highly viscous\nmaterials.

Some time ago, it has been pointed out (Egu\\'{\\i}luz et al., Phys.\nRev.

While this model reproduces the\ninput-output behaviour of the cochlea to some extent, the generated model\nresponses deviate significantly from physiological measurements. The reason for\nthe discrepancies between model and experiment are due to the critical choice\nof the Hopf control parameter close to the bifurcation point ($\\mu = 0$). The\nquestion whether the bifurcation parameter has to be chosen critically or\nsubcritically ($\\mu < 0$), is central, and has become the subject of a\nscientific debate.In this contribution, we argue that, for sustained input\nsignals, the control parameter will assume a subcritical value.

We argue that as a function of decreasing quark chemical potential\nmu or increasing M_s, there is a quantum phase transition from the CFL phase to\na new ``gapless CFL phase'' in which only seven quasiparticles have a gap. The\ntransition occurs where M_s^2/mu is approximately equal to 2*Delta, with Delta\nthe gap parameter. Gapless CFL, like CFL, leaves unbroken a linear combination\nQtilde of electric and color charges, but it is a Qtilde-conductor with a\nnonzero electron density. These electrons and the gapless quark quasiparticles\nmake the low energy effective theory of the gapless CFL phase and,\nconsequently, its astrophysical properties are qualitatively different from\nthose of the CFL phase, even though its U(1) symmetries are the same. Both\ngapless quasiparticles have quadratic dispersion relations at the quantum\ncritical point. For values of M_s^2/mu above the quantum critical point, one\nbranch has conventional linear dispersion relations while the other branch\nremains quadratic, up to tiny corrections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Nov 2003 19:17:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 2004 21:57:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

In\nparticular, four-fermion CP-violating interactions induced by Higgs exchange\nshould be accounted for alongside the constituent EDMs of quarks and electrons.\nTo this end, we present a comprehensive analysis of three low energy EDM\nobservables - namely the EDMs of thallium, mercury and the neutron - at large\ntan(beta), in terms of one- and two-loop contributions to the constituent EDMs\nand four-fermion interactions. We concentrate on the constrained MSSM as well\nas the MSSM with non-universal Higgs masses, and include the CP-violating\nphases of mu and A. Our results indicate that the atomic EDMs receive\nsignificant corrections from four-fermion operators, especially when Im(A) is\nthe only CP-violating source, whereas the neutron EDM remains relatively\ninsensitive to these effects. As a consequence, in a large portion of the\nparameter space, one cannot infer a separate bound on the electron EDM via the\nexperimental constraint on the thallium EDM. Furthermore, we find that the\nelectron EDM can be greatly reduced due to the destructive interference of one-\nand two-loop contributions with the latter being dominated by virtual staus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Nov 2003 23:10:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
