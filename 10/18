When this condition is no longer\nfulfilled, the shock is modified by the pressure of the accelerated particles\nin a nonlinear way, namely the spectrum of accelerated particles and the shock\nstructure determine each other.

The mean separation between clouds can\naffect which MRI mode dominates the evolution. Provided intercloud separations\ndo not exceed half the MRI wavelength, we find the MRI growth rates are similar\nto those for the corresponding uniform medium.
