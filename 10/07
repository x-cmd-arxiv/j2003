Combining the two improves\nparameter accuracies by a factor of three due to their complementarity. For the\ndark energy parameterization w(a) = w0 + wa(1-a), the marginalized errors from\nlensing alone are sigma(w0) = 0.03 fsky^{-1/2} and sigma(wa) = 0.1 fsky^{-1/2}.\nWe show that these constraints can be further improved when combined with\nmeasurements of the cosmic microwave background or Type Ia supernovae.

In our CDM-based scenario, galaxies form through the\nsuccessive merging of sub-galaxies with various masses. Their merging histories\nvary between a major merger at one extreme, and a monolithic collapse of a\nslow-rotating gas cloud at the other extreme. The basic processes driving the\nevolution of the metallicity gradients are as follows: i) destruction by\nmergers to an extent dependent on the progenitor mass ratio. ii) regeneration\nwhen strong central star formation is induced at a rate dependent on the gas\nmass of the secondary. iii) slow evolution as star formation is induced in the\nouter regions through late gas accretion. We succeed in reproducing the\nobserved variety of the radial metallicity gradients. The average gradient dlog\nZ/dlog r ~ -0.3 with dispersion of +- 0.2 and no correlation between gradient\nand galaxy mass are consistent with observations of Mg2 gradients. The variety\nof the gradients stems from the difference in the merging histories. Galaxies\nthat form monolithically have steeper gradients, while galaxies that undergo\nmajor mergers have shallower gradients. Thus merging histories can, in\nprinciple, be inferred from the observed metallicity gradients of present-day\ngalaxies.

Two possibilities for significant outward migration are\nidentified. First, cores that form early at radii of around 10 au can be\ncarried to larger radii via gravitational interaction with the gaseous disc.\nThis process is efficient if there is strong mass loss from the disc - either\nwithin a cluster or due to photoevaporation from a star more massive than the\nSun - but does not require the extremely destructive environment found, for\nexample, in the core of the Orion Nebula. We find that, depending upon the disc\nmodel, gas disc migration can yield massive planets (several Jupiter masses) at\nradii of around 20-50 au. Second, interactions within multiple planet systems\ncan drive the outer planet into a large, normally highly eccentric orbit.

In spectra published by Bouvier &\nAppenzeller (1992) these objects showed very weak H-alpha emission, broad CaII\nabsorption and so called ``composite spectra'', where the spectral type\ninferred from the blue region is earlier than that inferred from the red. We\npresent here new spectroscopy which shows that all four stars now exhibit\nstrong H-alpha emission, narrow CaII emission and a spectral type which is\nconsistent at all wavelengths.\n  We propose a scheme to understand these changes whereby the composite spectra\nof these stars can be explained by a period of active accretion onto the\ncentral, young star. In this scheme the composite spectrum consists of a\ncontribution from the stellar photosphere and a contribution from a hot,\noptically thick, accretion component. The optically thick nature of the\naccretion flow explains the weakness of the H-alpha emission during this phase.\nWithin this scheme, the change to a single spectral type at all wavelengths and\nemergence of strong H-alpha emission are consistent with the accretion columns\nbecoming optically thin, as the accretion rate drops. There is a strong analogy\nhere with the dwarf novae class of interacting binaries, which show similar\nbehaviour during the decline from outbursts of high mass-transfer rate.\n  The most important consequence of this interpretation is that these objects\nbring into question the association of Weak-Line T Tauri stars (WTTs) with\nnon-accreting or discless objects.

Since the\nSeiberg-Witten theory of the link $M$ provides a rational number for any\n$spin^c$ structure it was a natural challenge to search for a complete set of\nconjecturally valid identities, which involve all the Seiberg-Witten invariants\n(giving an analytic -- i.e. singularity theoretical -- interpretation of them).\n  The formulation of this set of identities is one of the goals of the present\narticle. In fact, we formulate conjecturally valid inequalities which became\nequalities in special rigid situations.\n  In this way, the Seiberg-Witten invariants determine optimal topological\nupper bounds for the dimensions of the first sheaf-cohomology of line bundles\nliving on the resolution. Moreover, for $\\Q$-Gorenstein singularities and some\n``natural'' line bundles equality holds.\n  The first part of the article constructs these ``natural'' holomorphic line\nbundles. The line-bundle construction is compatible with abelian covers.

In agreement with previously obtained results,\nthe evolution is found to be unitary and the generator of the Zeno dynamics is\nthe Hamiltonian with hard-wall (Dirichlet) boundary conditions. By using a new\napproach to this problem, this result is found to be valid in an arbitrary\n$N$-dimensional compact domain. We then propose some preliminary ideas\nconcerning the algebra of observables in the projected region and finally look\nat the case of a projection onto a lower dimensional space: in such a situation\nthe Zeno ansatz turns out to be a procedure to impose constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Oct 2003 09:40:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2004 11:22:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-31"}
