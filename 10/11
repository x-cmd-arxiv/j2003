For\nexample, merging binary neutron stars can form \"hypermassive\" remnants\nsupported against collapse by differential rotation. The removal of this\nsupport by magnetic braking induces radial fluid motion, which can lead to\ndelayed collapse of the remnant to a black hole. We explore the effects of\nmagnetic braking and viscosity on the structure of a differentially rotating,\ncompressible star, generalizing our earlier calculations for incompressible\nconfigurations.
