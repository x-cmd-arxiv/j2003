We find that the HI distribution in the galaxy is\nnot axi-symmetric, but shows density enhancements in the eastern and southern\nhalves of the galaxy. The optical emission is lopsided with respect to the HI,\nmost of the bright optical emission arises from the eastern half of the HI\ndisk. The velocity field of the galaxy is however quite regular and shows a\nsystematic large scale pattern, consistent with the rotational motion. The\nrotation curve for the galaxy shows a peak (inclination corrected) rotation\nvelocity of only ~8 km/s, comparable to the random motions in the HI gas. After\ncorrecting for the dynamical support provided by random motions (the\n``asymmetric drift'' correction), we find the corrected peak rotation velocity\nof ~16.0 km/s. Mass modeling of the corrected rotation curve shows that the\nkinematics of DDO210 can be well fit with either a modified isothermal halo\n(with a central density rho_0 ~ 29 X 10^{-3} M_\\odot pc^{-3} for a stellar mass\nto light ratio of 3.4) or an NFW halo.

An important\nconsequence of this is that the segregation of the galaxy population by\nlarge-scale environment is entirely due to the environmental dependence of the\nhalo population. In this paper we use such a model to predict how the galaxy\nluminosity function depends on large-scale environment. The latter is\nrepresented by the density contrast (delta) averaged over a spherical volume of\nradius R=8Mpc/h. The model predicts that the Schechter function is a good\napproximation to the luminosity functions of galaxies brighter than ~10^9\nh^{-2}L_sun (b_j-band) in virtually all environments. The characteristic\nluminosity, L^{\\star}, increases moderately with \\delta. The faint-end slope,\n\\alpha, on the other hand, is quite independent of $\\delta$. However, when\nsplitting the galaxy population into early and late types, it is found that for\nlate-types \\alpha is virtually constant, whereas for early-types \\alpha\nincreases from ~-0.3 in underdense regions (\\delta~-0.5) to ~-0.8 in highly\noverdense regions with \\delta ~ 10. The luminosity function at L_{b_j}<10^9\nh^{-2} L_sun is significantly steeper than the extrapolation of the Schechter\nfunction that fits the brighter galaxies. This steepening is more significant\nfor early-types and in low-density environments. The model also predicts that\nthe luminosity density and mass density are closely correlated. The relation\nbetween the two is monotonic but highly non-linear. This suggests that one can\nuse the luminosity density, averaged over a large volume, to rank the mass\ndensity. This, in turn, allows the environmental effects predicted here to be\ntested by observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Oct 2003 15:58:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2004 15:42:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Using the developing local nonequilibrium model of solidification,\nthe self-consistent analysis of linear morphological stability is presented\nwith the attribution to the marginal (neutral) and absolute morphological\nstability of a rapidly moving interface. Special consideration of the interface\nstability for the cases of solidification in negative and positive thermal\ngradients is given. A quantitative comparison of the model predictions for the\nabsolute morphological stability is presented with regard to experimental\nresults of Hoglund and Aziz (Hoglund DE, Aziz MJ. Mat Res Soc Symp Proc\n1992;205:325) on critical solute concentration for the interface breakdown\nduring rapid solidification of Si--Sn alloys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Oct 2003 07:55:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

These protocols\nare those that generate flow maps in pseudoAnosov isotopy classes. These\nclasses are a basic ingredient of the Thurston-Nielsen theory and a further\napplication of that theory shows that pseudoAnosov stirring protocols with\ngeneric initial vorticity always yield solutions to Euler's equations for which\nthe sup norm of the gradient of the vorticity grows exponentially in time.

These new data have smaller\nstatistical uncertainties and better understood systematic uncertainties, than\nthose obtained at the older bremsstrahlung facilities, for measurements of\ndifferential and integrated cross sections, as well as polarization and\nasymmetry. Experimental results are compared with the predictions of QCD-based\napproaches, such as the lattice-gauge calculations of baryon properties, and\nChiral Perturbation Theory applied to threshold photoproduction, and are\nessential to the performance of Partial-Wave Analyses (PWA). These PWA studies\nare less model dependent than in the past, and are used in coupled-channels\ncalculations that incorporate unitarity dynamically, and combine results from\nhadronic reaction channels with electromagnetic processes. This approach is\nnecessary to extract resonance properties and may lead to the discovery of the\n\"missing resonances\" predicted by a number of different QCD-inspired\ncalculations.

Many of the same genes are induced in\nthe defense responses of a wide range of plant species. How plant defense gene\nfamilies evolve may therefore provide an important clue to our understanding of\nhow disease resistance evolves. Because studies usually focus on a single host\nspecies, little data are available regarding changes in defense gene expression\npatterns as species diverge. The expression of defense-induced genes PR10,\nchitinase and chalcone synthase was assayed in four pea species (Pisum sativum,\nP. humile, P. elatius and P. fulvum) and two Lathyrus species (L. sativus and\nL. tingitanus) which exhibited a range of infection phenotypes with Fusarium\nsolani . In P. sativum, resistance was accompanied by a strong induction of\ndefense genes at 8 hr. post-inoculation. Weaker induction was seen in\nsusceptible interactions in wild species. Divergence in the timing of PR10\nexpression was most striking between P. sativum and its closest realtive, P.\nhumile. Two members of this multigene family, designated PR10.1 and PR10.2, are\nstrongly-expressed in response to Fusarium, while the PR10.3 gene is more\nweakly expressed, among Pisum species.
