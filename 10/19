On the other hand, this method can be used to suppress\nspatiotemporal chaos and turbulence in systems where these phenomena are\nalready present. This method can be generalized to even more general\nspatiotemporal systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Oct 2003 07:36:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
