We report an extensive study of the effects of central masses\non bars in high-quality N-body simulations of galaxies. We have varied the\ngrowth rate of the central mass, its final mass and degree of concentration to\nexamine how these factors affect the evolution of the bar. Our main conclusions\nare: (1) Bars are more robust than previously thought. The central mass has to\nbe as large as several percent of the disk mass to completely destroy the bar\non a short timescale. (2) For a given mass, dense objects cause the greatest\nreduction in bar amplitude, while significantly more diffuse objects have a\nlesser effect. (3) The bar amplitude always decreases as the central mass is\ngrown, and continues to decay thereafter on a cosmological time-scale. (4) The\nfirst phase of bar-weakening is due to the destruction by the CMC of\nlower-energy, bar-supporting orbits, while the second phase is a consequence of\nsecular changes to the global potential which further diminish the number of\nbar-supporting orbits. We provide detailed phase-space and orbit analysis to\nsupport this suggestion. Thus current masses of SMBHs are probably too small,\neven when dressed with a stellar cusp, to affect the bar in their host\ngalaxies. The molecular gas concentrations found in some barred galaxies are\nalso too diffuse to affect the amplitude of the bar significantly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Oct 2003 20:00:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The used perturbations of particle number per coordinate, not proper,\nvolume are generally constant on superhorizon scales. In real space an\nanalytical analysis can be extended beyond fluids to neutrinos.\n  The faster cosmological expansion due to the neutrino background changes the\nacoustic and damping angular scales of the cosmic microwave background (CMB).\nBut we find that equivalent changes can be produced by varying other standard\nparameters, including the primordial helium abundance. The low-l integrated\nSachs-Wolfe effect is also not sensitive to neutrinos. However, the gravity of\nneutrino perturbations suppresses the CMB acoustic peaks for the multipoles\nwith l>~200 while it enhances the amplitude of matter fluctuations on these\nscales. In addition, the perturbations of relativistic neutrinos generate a\n*unique phase shift* of the CMB acoustic oscillations that for adiabatic\ninitial conditions cannot be caused by any other standard physics. The origin\nof the shift is traced to neutrino free-streaming velocity exceeding the sound\nspeed of the photon-baryon plasma.

In addition, tidal interactions between giant planets in the solar\nsystem and their moons are thought to be responsible for the orbital migration\nof the satellites, leading to their capture into resonant configurations. We\ntreat the underlying fluid dynamical problem with the aim of determining the\nefficiency of tidal dissipation in gaseous giant planets. In cases of interest,\nthe tidal forcing frequencies are comparable to the spin frequency of the\nplanet but small compared to its dynamical frequency. We therefore study the\nlinearized response of a slowly and possibly differentially rotating planet to\nlow-frequency tidal forcing. Convective regions of the planet support inertial\nwaves, while any radiative regions support generalized Hough waves. We present\nillustrative numerical calculations of the tidal dissipation rate and argue\nthat inertial waves provide a natural avenue for efficient tidal dissipation in\nmost cases of interest. The resulting value of Q depends in a highly erratic\nway on the forcing frequency, but we provide evidence that the relevant\nfrequency-averaged dissipation rate may be asymptotically independent of the\nviscosity in the limit of small Ekman number. In short-period extrasolar\nplanets, if the stellar irradiation of the planet leads to the formation of a\nradiative outer layer that supports generalized Hough modes, the tidal\ndissipation rate can be enhanced through the excitation and damping of these\nwaves. These dissipative mechanisms offer a promising explanation of the\nhistorical evolution and current state of the Galilean satellites as well as\nthe observed circularization of the orbits of short-period extrasolar planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Oct 2003 15:59:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Strongly stochastic in the classical\nlimit, these systems are frequently employed as models of quantum chaos. We\nshow that despite their classical stochasticity all scaling quantum graphs are\nexplicitly solvable in the form $E_n=f(n)$, where $n$ is the sequence number of\nthe energy level of the quantum graph and $f$ is a known function, which\ndepends only on the physical and geometrical properties of the quantum graph.\nOur method of solution motivates a new classification scheme for quantum\ngraphs: we show that each quantum graph can be uniquely assigned an integer $m$\nreflecting its level of complexity. We show that a taut string with piecewise\nconstant mass density provides an experimentally realizable analogue system of\nscaling quantum graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Oct 2003 00:39:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2004 01:50:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 2004 00:41:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
