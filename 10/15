The strongly off-centered position of the\npulsar with respect to its pulsar wind nebula is naturally explained by the\nresult of the interaction of the reverse shock with the pulsar wind nebula, as\nthe simulation bears out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2003 10:10:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Our goal is to\ndetermine the sensitivity of the properties of the resulting stars and brown\ndwarfs to variations in the initial conditions imposed. In this paper we report\non the results obtained by applying two different initial turbulent velocity\nfields. The slope of the turbulent power-law spectrum alpha is set to -3 in\nhalf of the calculations and to -5 in the other half. We find that, whereas the\nstellar mass function seems to only be weakly dependent on the value of alpha,\nthe sub-stellar mass function turns out to be more sensitive to the initial\nslope of the velocity field. We argue that, since the role of turbulence is to\ncreate substructure from which gravitational instabilities may grow, variations\nin other initial conditions that also determine the fragmentation process are\nlikely to affect the shape of the sub-stellar mass function as well. The\nabsence of many planetary mass `free-floaters' in our simulations, especially\nin the mass range 1-10 MJ, suggests that, if these objects are abundant, they\nare likely to form by similar mechanisms to those thought to operate in\nquiescent accretion discs, instead of via instabilities in gravitationally\nunstable discs. Finally, we find that multiple and single stars share\ncomparable kinematical properties, both populations being able to attain\nvelocities in the range 1-10 km/s. From these values we draw the conclusion\nthat only low-mass star-forming regions such as Taurus-Auriga or Ophiuchus,\nwhere the escape speed is low, might have suffered some depletion of its single\nand binary stellar population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2003 10:24:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Then the\nexchange energies are extrapolated to larger sizes in order to evaluate their\ncontributions to the leading term of the magnetic susceptibility and the\nspecific heat. These results are used to check the convergence of the\nmulti-spin exchange model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Oct 2003 16:42:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-16"}

The\nelectroweak interactions of pions result from gauging an SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y\nsymmetry which then breaks to the U(1)_{em} gauge symmetry of electromagnetism.\nThe electromagnetic interactions of magnons arise from gauging not only\nU(1)_{em} but also the SU(2)_s spin rotational symmetry, with the\nelectromagnetic fields E and B appearing as non-Abelian vector potentials.\nPions couple to electromagnetism through a Goldstone-Wilczek current that\nrepresents the baryon number of Skyrmions and gives rise to the decay \\pi^0 to\n\\gamma \\gamma. Similarly, magnons may couple to an analogue of the\nGoldstone-Wilczek current for baby-Skyrmions which induces a magnon-two-photon\nvertex. The corresponding analogue of photon-axion conversion is photon-magnon\nconversion in an external magnetic field. The baryon number violating decay of\nSkyrmions can be catalyzed by a magnetic monopole via the Callan-Rubakov\neffect. Similarly, baby-Skyrmion decay can be catalyzed by a charged wire.

We develop a \"frame-invariant\"\nformalism that allows the computation of the rest mass and its variation as\nobserved in 4D. We find the appropriate expression for the four-acceleration\nand thus obtain the extra force observed in 4D. Our formulae extend and\ngeneralize all previous results in the literature. An important result here is\nthat the extra force in brane-world models with ${\\bf Z}_{2}$-symmetry is\ncontinuous and well defined across the brane. This is because the momentum\ncomponent along the extra dimension is discontinuous across the brane, which\neffectively compensates the discontinuity of the extrinsic curvature.

Threshold production can be exploited for measurements of the\nselectron and smuon masses, an essential ingredient for the reconstruction of\nthe fundamental supersymmetric theory at high scales. The production of\nselectrons in the continuum will allow us to determine the Yukawa couplings in\nthe selectron sector, scrutinizing the identity of the Yukawa and gauge\ncouplings, which is a basic consequence of supersymmetry. The theoretical\npredictions are elaborated at the one-loop level in the continuum, while at\nthreshold non-zero width effects and Sommerfeld rescattering corrections are\nincluded. The phenomenological analyses are performed for e+e- and e-e- linear\ncolliders with energy up to about 1 TeV and with high integrated luminosity up\nto 1 ab^-1 to cover the individual slepton channels separately with high\nprecision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2003 15:46:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2004 20:24:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Families of symmetric and antisymmetric solutions are found\nanalytically, extending beyond the spectral gap in both the dual- and tri-core\nsystems. Moreover, these families persist in the case (strong coupling between\nthe cores) when there is no gap in the system's linear spectrum. Three\ndifferent types of asymmetric solitons are found in the tri-core system. They\nexist only inside the spectral gap, but asymmetric solitons with nonvanishing\ntails are found outside the gap as well. The symmetric solitons are stable up\nto points at which two types of asymmetric solitons bifurcate from them. Beyond\nthe bifurcation, one type of the asymmetric solitons is stable, and the other\nis not. Then, they swap their stability. In both the dual- and tri-core\nsystems, the stability region of the symmetric solitons extends far beyond the\ngap, persisting in the case when the system has no gap at all. The whole\nstability region of antisymmetric solitons is located outside the gap.

On one hand, due to\nfascinating accuracy of atomic clocks, the traditional macroscopic standards of\nmetrology (second, metre, kilogram) are giving way to standards based on\nfundamental units of nature: velocity of light $c$ and quantum of action $h$.\nOn the other hand, the poor precision of gravitational constant $G$, which is\nwidely believed to define the ``cube of theories'' and the units of the future\n``theory of everything'', does not allow to use $G$ as a fundamental\ndimensional constant in metrology. The electromagnetic units in SI are actually\nbased on concepts of prerelativistic classical electrodynamics such as ether,\nelectric permitivity and magnetic permeability of vacuum. Concluding remarks\nare devoted to terminological confusion which accompanies the progress in basic\nphysics and metrology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2003 15:07:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

Therefore, the lifetime for both bound and free states is of the same\norder of magnitude and ranges between 0.1 and 1.0 ps for realistic parameters.\nBy contrast, the relaxation channels strongly depend on the nature of the\ntwo-vibron states which is a consequence of the breather-like behavior of the\ntwo-vibron bound states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2003 15:09:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Usually the environment involves a relatively large\nnumber of degrees of freedom, this making the problem numerically intractable\nfrom a purely quantum-mechanical point of view. To overcome this drawback, a\nnew class of quantum trajectories is proposed. These trajectories, based on the\nsame grounds as Bohmian ones, are solely associated to the system reduced\ndensity matrix, since the evolution of the environment degrees of freedom is\nnot considered explicitly. Within this approach, environment effects come into\nplay through a time-dependent damping factor that appears in the system\nequations of motion. Apart from their evident computational advantage, this\ntype of trajectories also results very insightful to understand the system\ndecoherence.

We instead investigate entanglement\npurification protocols with two-way classical side channels (2-EPPs) for finite\nblock sizes. In particular, we consider the analog of the minimum distance\nproblem for QECCs, and show that 2-EPPs can exceed the quantum Hamming bound\nand the quantum Singleton bound.
