First, I analyze a theory with a logarithmic\nspectrum, and show how to use partial supersymmetry to reveal the underlying\nstructure of this theory. This method reveals an intriguing equivalence between\ntwo formulations of this theory, one of which is one-dimensional, and the other\nof which is infinite-dimensional. Second, I demonstrate the use of partial\nsupersymmetry as a tool to obtain the asymptotic energy levels in\nnon-relativistic quantum mechanics in an exceptionally easy way. In the end, I\ndiscuss possible extensions of this work, including the possible connections\nbetween partial supersymmetry and renormalization group arguments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Oct 2003 16:18:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Nov 2003 01:27:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
