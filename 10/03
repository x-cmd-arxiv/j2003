In almost all cases, the shape of\nthe excess is consistent with that of a single-temperature blackbody with T ~\n1400 K, similar to the expected dust sublimation temperature for typical dust\ncompositions. The amount of excess flux roughly correlates with the accretion\nluminosity in objects with similar stellar properties. We compare our\nobservations with the predictions of simple disk models having an inner rim\nlocated at the dust sublimation radius, including irradiation heating of the\ndust from both the stellar and accretion luminosities. The models yield inner\nrim radii in the range 0.07-0.54 AU, increasing with higher stellar and\naccretion luminosities. Using typical parameters which fit our observed sample,\nwe predict a rim radius ~ 0.2 AU for the T Tauri star DG Tau, which agrees with\nrecent Keck near-infrared interferometric measurements. For large mass\naccretion rates, the inner rim lies beyond the corotation radius at (or within)\nwhich magnetospheric accretion flows are launched, which implies that pure\ngaseous disks must extend inside the dust rim. Thus, for a significant fraction\nof young stars, dust cannot exist in the innermost disk, calling into question\ntheories in which solid particles are ejected by a wind originating at the\nmagnetospheric radius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Oct 2003 17:29:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The discovery of such a transit would be\nan important astronomical advance, bridging the critical gap in understanding\nbetween HD209458b and Jupiter. However, the task is made difficult by\nintrinsically low transit probabilities and small transit duty cycles. This\nproject's efficient and economical strategy is to photometrically monitor stars\nthat are known (from radial velocity surveys) to bear planets, using a network\nof widely-spaced observers with small telescopes. These observers, each\nindividually capable of precision (1%) differential photometry, monitor\ncandidates during the time windows in which the radial velocity solution\npredicts a transit if the orbital inclination is close to 90 degrees. We use\nMonte Carlo techniques to simulate the performance of this network, performing\nsimulations with different configurations of observers in order to optimize\ncoordination of an actual campaign. Our results indicate that transitsearch.org\ncan reliably rule out or detect planetary transits within the current catalog\nof known planet-bearing stars. A distributed network of skilled amateur\nastronomers and small college observatories is a cost-effective method for\ndiscovering the small number of transiting planets with periods in the range\n10d < P < 200d that orbit bright (V < 11) stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Oct 2003 06:26:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The X-ray spectra show features typical of the high/soft\nspectral state, and can approximately be described by an optically thick disk\nspectrum plus a power-law tail. Three distinct spectral regimes, named standard\nregime, anomalous regime, and apparently standard regime, have been found from\nthe entire set of the observed spectra. When the X-ray luminosity is well below\n6E38 erg/s (assuming a distance of 5 kpc), XTE J1550-564 resides in the\nstandard regime, where the soft spectral component dominates the power-law\ncomponent and the observed disk inner radius is kept constant. When the\nluminosity exceeds the critical luminosity, the apparently standard regime is\nrealized, where luminosity of the optically thick disk rises less steeply with\nthe temperature, and the spectral shape is moderately distorted from that of\nthe standard accretion disk. In this regime, radial temperature gradient of the\ndisk has been found to be flatter than that of the standard accretion disk. The\nresults of the apparently standard regime are suggestive of a slim disk (e.g.,\nAbramowicz et al. 1988, Watarai et al. 2000) which is a solution predicted\nunder high mass accretion rate. In the intermediate anomalous regime, the\nspectrum becomes much harder, and the disk inner radius derived using a simple\ndisk model spectrum apparently varies significantly with time. These properties\ncan be explained as a result of significant thermal inverse Comptonization of\nthe disk photons, as was found from GRO J1655-40 in its anomalous regime by\nKubota, Makishima and Ebisawa (2001).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Oct 2003 07:11:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We have tested and compared different versions\nof the statistical model, with special emphasis on possible explanations of the\nobserved strangeness hadronic phase space under-saturation. We show that, in\nthis energy range, the use of hadron yields at midrapidity instead of in full\nphase space artificially enhances strangeness production and could lead to\nincorrect conclusions as far as the occurrence of full chemical equilibrium is\nconcerned. In addition to the basic model with an extra strange quark\nnon-equilibrium parameter, we have tested three more schemes: a two-component\nmodel superimposing hadrons coming out of single nucleon-nucleon interactions\nto those emerging from large fireballs at equilibrium, a model with local\nstrangeness neutrality and a model with strange and light quark non-equilibrium\nparameters. The behaviour of the source parameters as a function of colliding\nsystem and collision energy is studied. The description of strangeness\nproduction entails a non-monotonic energy dependence of strangeness saturation\nparameter gamma_S with a maximum around 30A GeV.

Anisotropic\nflow is obtained from the zeroes in the complex plane of a generating function\nof azimuthal correlations, in close analogy with the theory of phase\ntransitions by Lee and Yang. Flow is first estimated globally, i.e., averaged\nover the phase space covered by the detector, and then differentially, as a\nfunction of transverse momentum and rapidity for identified particles. The\ncorresponding estimates are less biased by nonflow correlations than with any\nother method. The practical implementation of the method is rather\nstraightforward. Furthermore, it automatically takes into account most\ncorrections due to azimuthal anisotropies in the detector acceptance. The main\nlimitation of the method is statistical errors, which can be significantly\nlarger than with the ``standard'' method of flow analysis if the flow and/or\nthe event multiplicities are too small.

The entanglement structure is\nintroduced as an additional ingredient to the description of the linear space\ncarrying the adjoint representation. Positive maps of density operator are\nrelated to random matrices. The tomographic probability description of quantum\nstates is used to formulate the problem of separability and entanglement as the\ncondition for joint probability distribution of several random variables\nrepresented as the convex sum of products of probabilities of random variables\ndescribing the subsystems. The property is discussed as a possible criterion\nfor separability or entanglement. The convenient criterion of positivity of\nfinite and infinite matrix is obtained. The U(n)-tomogram of a multiparticle\nspin state is introduced. The entanglement measure is considered in terms of\nthis tomogram.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Oct 2003 15:21:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
