A\nlong-standing theoretical prediction is that the high inclination of the M31\ndisk should induce an asymmetry in the spatial distribution of M31 Macho\nevents, whilst the distribution of variable stars and microlensing events in\nthe M31 disk should be symmetric. We examine the role of stars in the M31\nvisible spheroid as both lenses and sources to microlensing events. We compute\nmicrolensing event number density maps and estimate pixel-lensing rates and\nevent durations for three-component models of M31 which are consistent with the\nobserved rotation curve, surface brightness profile and dynamical mass\nestimates. Three extreme models are considered: a massive spheroid model; a\nmassive disk model; and a massive Macho halo model. An important consequence of\nthe spheroid is that, even if Machos are absent in M31, an asymmetric spatial\nsignature is still generally expected from stellar lensing alone. The relative\nmass-to-light ratio of the spheroid and disk populations controls which of\nthese signatures dominates the overall stellar spatial distribution. We find\nthat the inclusion of the spheroid weakens the M31 Macho spatial asymmetry by\nabout 20-30% over a disk-only asymmetry for the models considered. We also find\nfor our models that Machos dominate over most of the far disk provided they\ncontribute at least ~25% of the halo dark matter density. The presence of the\nspheroid also has beneficial consequences for M31 lensing surveys. The stellar\nasymmetry is likely to be important in distinguishing between a spheroidal\nMacho halo or a highly flattened halo or dark matter dominated disk, since\nspatial asymmetries of opposing signs are expected in these cases.

For this end, we compare the spectra obtained at\ndifferent spatial scales in a sample of infrared bright galaxies. ISO\nobservations which include emission of the nucleus as well as most of the host\ngalaxy are compared with TIMMI2 spectra of the nuclear region. We find that ISO\nspectra are generally dominated by strong PAH bands. However, this is no longer\ntrue when inspecting the mid-infrared emission of the pure nucleus. Here PAH\nemission is detected in starbursts whereas it is significantly reduced or\ncompletely absent in AGNs. A physical explanation of these new observational\nresults is presented by examining the temperature fluctuation of a PAH after\ninteraction with a photon. It turns out that the hardness of the radiation\nfield is a key parameter for quantifying the photo-destruction of small grains.\nOur theoretical study predicts PAH evaporation in soft X-ray environments.\nRadiative transfer calculations of clumpy starbursts and AGN corroborate the\nobservational fact that PAH emission is connected to starburst activity whereas\nPAHs are destroyed near an AGN. The radiative transfer models predict for\nstarbursts a much larger mid-infrared size than for AGN.

Pore\ntranslocation of RNA or DNA is biased due to the different chemical\nenvironments on the two sides of the membrane, while the molecular motor motion\nis biased through a coupling to chemical energy. An externally applied force\ncan oppose these biases. For both systems we solve lattice models exactly both\nwith and without disorder. The models incorporate explicitly the coupling to\nthe different chemical environments for polymer translocation and the coupling\nto the chemical energy (as well as nucleotide pairing energies) for molecular\nmotors. Using the exact solutions and general arguments we show that the\nheterogeneity leads to anomalous dynamics. Most notably, over a range of forces\naround the stall force (or stall tension for DNA polymerase/exonuclease\nsystems) the displacement grows sublinearly as t^\\mu with \\mu<1. The range over\nwhich this behavior can be observed experimentally is estimated for several\nsystems and argued to be detectable for appropriate forces and buffers. Similar\nsequence heterogeneity effects may arise in the packing of viral DNA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Oct 2003 14:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2004 21:02:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Besides e+e- -\nannihilation data also tau decay spectra can help to get better predictions.\nHere, it is important to account for all possible iso-spin violations in tau -\ndecay spectra, from which e+e- cross sections may be obtained by an iso-spin\nrotation. The observed 10% discrepancy in the region above the rho may be\nunderstood as a so far unaccounted iso-spin breaking effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Oct 2003 09:36:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We show that, in the case of pure\nquantum states, one can quantify the nonlocal properties by only two additive\nmeasures, and that all states with the same measures can be asymptotically\ninterconverted into each other by local operations and classical communication.\nFurthermore we discuss how superselection rules affect the concepts of\nmajorization, teleportation and mixed state entanglement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Oct 2003 13:08:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
