The H-alpha recession\nvelocities of most of the filaments of the region observed are highly\nblue-shifted with respect to the systemic velocity of the galaxy. The velocity\nfield is complicated, and from the kinematic and morphological points of view,\nthere seem to be several streams of filaments: low velocity (v = -100 km/s)\nfilaments, high velocity (v = -300 km/s) filaments, and a very high velocity (v\n> -500 km/s) cloud complex. The emission-line ratios of the VEELR filaments are\nwell explained by power-law photoionization models with solar abundances,\nsuggesting that the Seyfert nucleus of NGC 4388 is the dominant ionization\nsource of the VEELR and that the VEELR gas has moderate metallicity. In\naddition to photoionization, shock heating probably contributes to the\nionization of the gas. In particular, the filaments outside the ionization cone\nof the Seyfert nucleus are mainly excited by shocks. We conclude that the VEELR\nwas formerly the disk gas of NGC 4388, which has been stripped by ram pressure\ndue to the interaction between the hot intra-cluster medium (ICM) and the\ngalaxy. The velocity field and the morphology of the VEELR closely resemble\nsnapshots from some numerical simulations of this process.

The only general method of this kind\nis the root model based on the representation of the probability density as a\nsquared absolute value of a certain function, which is referred to as a\npsi-function in analogy with quantum mechanics. The psi-function is represented\nby an expansion in terms of an orthonormal set of functions. It is shown that\nthe introduction of the psi-function allows one to represent the Fisher\ninformation matrix as well as statistical properties of the estimator of the\nstate vector (state estimator) in simple analytical forms. A new statistical\ncharacteristic, a confidence cone, is introduced instead of a standard\nconfidence interval. The chi-square test is considered to test the hypotheses\nthat the estimated vector converges to the state vector of a general population\nand that both samples are homogeneous. The expansion coefficients are estimated\nby the maximum likelihood method. The method proposed may be applied to its\nfull extent to solve the statistical inverse problem of quantum mechanics (root\nestimator of quantum states). In order to provide statistical completeness of\nthe analysis, it is necessary to perform measurements in mutually complementing\nexperiments (according to the Bohr terminology). The maximum likelihood\ntechnique and likelihood equation are generalized in order to analyze quantum\nmechanical experiments. It is shown that the requirement for the expansion to\nbe of a root kind can be considered as a quantization condition making it\npossible to choose systems described by quantum mechanics from all statistical\nmodels consistent, on average, with the laws of classical mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Oct 2003 08:38:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
