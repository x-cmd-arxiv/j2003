Coincident with this burst activity were\ngross changes in the pulsed flux, persistent flux, energy spectrum, pulse\nprofile and spin down of the underlying X-ray source. We present RXTE and\nXMM-Newton observations of 1E 2259+586 that show the evolution of the\naforementioned source parameters during and following this episode.\nSpecifically, we observe an X-ray flux increase by more than an order of\nmagnitude having two distinct components. The first component is linked to the\nburst activity and decays within ~2 days during which the energy spectrum is\nconsiderably harder than during the quiescent state of the source. The second\ncomponent decays over the year following the glitch according to a power law in\ntime with an exponent -0.22 +/- 0.01. The pulsed fraction decreased initially\nto ~15% RMS, and the pulse profile changed significantly during the outburst. A\nglitch was observed in 1E 2259+586 that preceded the observed burst activity. A\nfraction of the glitch (~19%) recovered, although the recovery was not purely\nexponential. An exponential rise of ~20% of the frequency jump with a time\nscale of ~14 days results in a significantly better fit to the data, however,\ncontamination from a systematic drift in the phase of the pulse profile cannot\nbe excluded.

It is found that the black hole masses are in the range of $\\sim\n10^{8}-10^{10}M_{\\odot}$. A significant correlation is found between the\nDoppler factor $\\delta$ and the core dominance parameter $R$. The results are\nconsistent with the external radiation Compton (ERC) models for $\\gamma$-ray\nemission from AGNs.

In this object - and in many other TeV\nblazars - the precise measurement of the shape of the X-ray spectrum, which\nreflects the high energy portion of the synchrotron component, is crucial in\ndetermining the high energy cutoff of the accelerated electrons in the jet.\nThanks to the simultaneous broadband coverage, we measured the 0.1-25 keV\nspectrum resolved on time scales as short as several hours, providing a great\nopportunity to investigate the detailed spectral evolution at the flares. By\nanalyzing the time subdivided observations, we parameterize the evolution of\nthe synchrotron peak, where the radiation power dominates, by fitting the\ncombined spectra with a quadratic form (where the vFv flux at the energy E\nobeys log vFv(E)=log(vFv_peak) - const x (log E - log Epeak)^2).

Unlike the standard\nslow-roll scenarios the \"clock\" ending the second inflationary phase is not a\nlocal order parameter, but rather the average value of an oscillating scalar\nfield, which locks the system at a saddle point of the potential in a temporary\ninflationary state. Inflation ends when the amplitude drops below a certain\ncritical point and liberates the system from the false vacuum state. The second\nstage of inflation has only about 50 e-foldings, a number which is determined\nentirely by the ratio of the fundamental mass scales, such as the Planck/string\nscale and the supersymmetry breaking scale.

In this way, the model is transformed into a six-dimensional\nmapping $\\mathbf{x}(t_{n})\\to \\mathbf{x}(t_{n+1})$, where $t_n$ are time\nmoments when a block starts to move or stops. Between these moments, the\nequations of motion are integrable. For $a<0.1$, the motion is quasiperiodic or\nperiodic, depending on the initial conditions. For the periodic solution, we\nobserve a synchronization of the motion of the lateral blocks. For $a>0.1$, the\nmotion becomes chaotic. These results are true for the linearized mapping,\nlinearized numerical and non-linearized numerical solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Oct 2003 15:22:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
