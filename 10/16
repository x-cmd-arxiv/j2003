Both of these results have profound implications for\nthe nature of GRB progenitors and for the use of GRBs as a probe of cosmology\nand the early universe.

We verify that the observed virial\nrelations of disk galaxies are given by Vobs \\prop L^0.31 and Rd \\prop L^0.33\nusing distance-redshift surveys of high surface brightness (HSB) and low\nsurface brightness (LSB) non-interacting galaxies.

The TF\nresiduals are fully independent of SB and other tested observables. TF\nrelations (TFRs) for various morphological types have different zero points,\nbut a common slope, such that early-type (redder) disks rotate faster than\nlater-types (bluer) of the same luminosity. This dependence of the TFR is a\ndirect consequence of the more fundamental dependence on color, which itself is\nrelated to the galaxy star formation history. The SL relation scatter is mostly\ndominated by SB, but color also plays a small role. The TF and SL residuals for\nHSB and LSB galaxies are weakly correlated, in agreement with the earlier claim\nby Courteau & Rix (1999). This suggests that spiral disks of all color,\nbrightness, and barredness are, on average, dominated by dark matter even in\ntheir inner parts. The observed scaling relations of disk galaxies are likely\nthe result of the simplest scenario of galaxy formation, but their color\ndependence remains a challenge to hierarchical structure formation models.

One objective is to characterize the intrinsic X-ray emission\nfrom the central black hole, SgrA*, in its quiescent and flaring states. We\ncorrect the fluxes observed by the Chandra and XMM telescopes for absorption\nand scattering, using realistic models for the dust grain size distribution,\ngas and dust abundances and spatial distributions. However, there are still\nlarge uncertainties. Since much of the intervening dust is close to SgrA*, the\nscattered halo of X-ray photons is very concentrated: its intensity can\ndominate the Chandra PSF inside 1\", and so affects estimates of the point\nsource flux. It also broadens the radial intensity profiles of Galactic center\nsources - observations of this effect can help constrain models of the spatial\ndistribution of the dust. We estimate that the combined scattering halos from\nobserved Galactic center sources within 10\" of SgrA* contribute up to ~10% of\nthe observed diffuse emission in this region. Dust-scattered photons suffer a\ntime delay relative to the photons that arrive directly. For dust that is 100\npc towards us from the Galactic center, this delay is about 1000 s at angles of\n1\", and 100 ks at 10\". We illustrate how the evolution of the scattering halo\nfollowing X-ray flares from SgrA* or other sources can also help to constrain\nthe dust's line of sight distribution. We discuss the implications of X-ray\nscattering halos for the intensity of diffuse emission that has been reported\nwithin a few arcseconds of SgrA*: in the most extreme, yet viable, model we\nconsider, ~1/3 of it is due to dust scattering of an unresolved source.

We assume the neutron star to be low--magnetized (B~10^8 G).\nIn the systems investigated in this paper, our computations show that during\nthe binary evolution the companion transfers as much as 1 solar mass to the\nneutron star, with an accretion rate of 10^-9 solar masses/yr. This is\nsufficient to keep the inner rim of the accretion disc in contact with the\nneutron star surface, thus preventing the onset of a propeller phase capable of\nejecting a significant fraction of the matter transferred by the companion. We\nfind that, for neutron stars governed by equations of state from soft up to\nmoderately stiff, an accretion induced collapse to a black hole is almost\nunavoidable. The collapse to a black hole can occur either during the accretion\nphase or after the end of the mass transfer when the neutron star is left in a\nsupramassive sequence. In this last case the collapse is driven by energy\nlosses of the fast spinning radio pulsar. For extremely supramassive neutron\nstars these energy losses cause a spin up. As a consequence the pulsar will\nhave a much shorter lifetime than that of a canonical radio pulsar. This\nbehavior depends on the equation of state for ultra-dense matter and therefore\ncould be used to constrain the internal structure of the neutron star. If the\nr-modes of the neutron star are excited during the accretion process, the\ngravitational waves emisson limits the maximum spin attainable by a NS to\nroughly 2 ms. In this case the collapse during the accretion phase is even more\ncommon since the maximum mass achievable before the collapse to a black hole\nduring accretion is smaller due to the limited spin frequency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Oct 2003 15:52:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

If an application's I/O\nneeds are met by making many small, distinct I/O requests, however, the I/O\nperformance degrades drastically. To avoid this problem, MPI-IO allows users to\naccess noncontiguous data with a single I/O function call, unlike in Unix I/O.\nIn this paper, we explain how critical this feature of MPI-IO is for high\nperformance and how it enables implementations to perform optimizations. We\nfirst provide a classification of the different ways of expressing an\napplication's I/O needs in MPI-IO--we classify them into four levels, called\nlevel~0 through level~3. We demonstrate that, for applications with\nnoncontiguous access patterns, the I/O performance improves dramatically if\nusers write their applications to make level-3 requests (noncontiguous,\ncollective) rather than level-0 requests (Unix style). We then describe how our\nMPI-IO implementation, ROMIO, delivers high performance for noncontiguous\nrequests. We explain in detail the two key optimizations ROMIO performs: data\nsieving for noncontiguous requests from one process and collective I/O for\nnoncontiguous requests from multiple processes.

Using\nlattice Go models we show that DeltaT/T_F ~ N^-1, where T_F is the folding\ntransition temperature and DeltaT is the folding transition width. This finding\nis consistent with finite size effects expected for the systems undergoing a\nphase transition from a disordered to an ordered phase. The dependence of the\nfolding rates k_F on N for lattice models and the dataset of 57 proteins and\npeptides shows that k_F = k_F^0 exp(-CN^beta) provides a good fit, if 0 < beta\n<= 2/3 and C is a constant. We find that k_F = k_F^0 exp(-1.1N^0.5) with k_F^0\n=(0.4x10^-6 s)^-1 can estimate optimal protein folding rates to within an order\nof magnitude in most cases. By using this fit for a set of proteins with\nbeta-sheet topology we find that k_F^0 is approximately equal to k_U^0, the\nprefactor for unfolding rates. The maximum ratio of k_U^0/k_F^0 is 10 for this\nclass of proteins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Oct 2003 00:27:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
