Depending on the model used, M81 X-9\nwas observed at a luminosity of L_X = 1.0-1.6 E+40 erg/s (0.3--10.0 keV). The\nvariability previously observed in this source signals that it is an accreting\nsource which likely harbors a black hole.

Like NGC\n1313 X-1, scaling the temperatures measured in M81 X-9 to those commonly seen\nin stellar-mass Galactic black holes at their highest observed fluxes (kT ~ 1\nkeV) may imply that M81 X-9 harbors a black hole with a mass on the order of\n10^3 Msun; the measured disk component normalization and broad-band luminosity\nimply black hole masses on the order of 10^2 Msun.

We consider growing networks in\nwhich the number of outgoing links is a non-linear function of time but new\nlinks between older nodes are forbidden. The attachments are made using a\npreferential attachment scheme. In the deterministic picture, the number of\noutgoing links $m(t)$ at any time $t$ is taken as $N(t)^\\theta$ where $N(t)$ is\nthe number of nodes present at that time. The continuum theory predicts a power\nlaw decay of the degree distribution: $P(k) \\propto k^{-1-\\frac{2}\n{1-\\theta}}$, while the degree of the node introduced at time $t_i$ is given by\n$k(t_i,t) = t_i^{\\theta}[ \\frac {t}{t_i}]^{\\frac {1+\\theta}{2}}$ when the\nnetwork is evolved till time $t$.

The dynamics of s(t) in such a limit would\nbe diffusive, with a mean translocation time scaling as N^2 in the absence of a\nforce, and proportional to N when a force is applied. We demonstrate that the\nassumption of equilibrium must break down for sufficiently long polymers (more\neasily when forced), and provide lower bounds for the translocation time by\ncomparison to unimpeded motion of the polymer.

In such theories, dimensional reduction generically leads to at\nleast two radion fields, one associated with the total volume of the extra\nspatial dimensions, and the other with the ratio of the sizes of small and\nlarge extra dimensions. In this paper, we discuss the impact of the radion\nfields on cosmology. We emphasize various aspects of radion physics such as\nradion coupling to the Standard Model fields, bare and dressed radion masses\nduring inflation, dynamical stabilization of radions during and after\ninflation, radion decay life time and its late dominance in thermal history of\nthe Universe as well as its quantum fluctuations during inflation. We argue\nthat models where the radion plays the role of an inflaton or the inflaton is a\nbrane scalar field, run into problems. We then present a successful inflation\nmodel with bulk scalar fields that seems to have all the desired properties. We\nalso briefly discuss the possibility of radion as a cold dark matter candidate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Oct 2003 19:33:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The\nlog-profile assumption is not used in this approach. Both Dirichlet and Newman\nboundary-value problems are considered. A method for complementing solution\nnear a wall is suggested. Although the generalized wall-functions are realized\nfor the k-epsilon model, generalization to other turbulence models looks quite\nclear. The general approach suggested is applicable to studying\nhigh-temperature regimes with variable laminar viscosity and density. A robust\nnumerical algorithm is proposed for implementation of Robin-type\nwall-functions. Preliminary test results made for a channel flow showed good\naccuracy and a weak dependence of the solution on the location of the\nintermediate boundary where the boundary conditions are set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Oct 2003 14:34:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Cerevisiae allow us to\naccess the effects of gene duplication on robustness and plasticity of\nmolecular networks. We demonstrate that the upstream transcriptional regulation\nof duplicated genes diverges fast, losing on average 4% of their common\ntranscription factors for every 1% divergence of their amino acid sequences. In\ncontrast, the set of physical interaction partners of their protein products\nchanges much slower. The relative stability of downstream functions of\nduplicated genes, is further corroborated by their ability to substitute for\neach other in gene knockout experiments. We believe that the combination of the\nupstream plasticity and the downstream robustness is a general feature\ndetermining the evolvability of molecular networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Oct 2003 13:11:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
