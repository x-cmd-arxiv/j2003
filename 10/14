We find\nthat it is difficult to reionise the IGM at z_rei>10 with stellar sources even\nafter making extreme assumptions. If star formation in 10^9 M_\\odot galaxies is\nnot suppressed by SN explosions, the optical depth to Thomson scattering is\ntau_e< 0.13. If we allow for the normal energy input from SNe or if\npair-instability SNe are dominant, we find taue<0.09. Assuming normal yields\nfor the first stars (popIII), the mean metallicity of the IGM is already\nZ/Z_\\odot=2x10^-3 (10^-3<Z/Z_\\odot<1 in overdense regions) when the IGM mean\nionisation fraction is less than 10%. For these reasons popIII stars cannot\ncontribute significantly to reionisation unless the mechanical energy input\nfrom SNe is greatly reduced and either the metal yield or the mixing efficiency\nis reduced by a factor of 1000. Both problems have a solution if popIII stars\ncollapse to black holes.

In particular we study under which circumstances\nthis decay may produce a significant reionization at high redshift ($z \\simeq\n20$), as requested by the WMAP result.Extra sources of reionization at high\nredshifts increase the recombination rate. As a result, the number density of\ndecaying particles required to produce a high level of ionization at $z \\simeq\n10-20$ is significantly higher ($\\simeq 300$ times) than previously estimated.\nMoreover, the ionization produced by decay particles implies a high optical\ndepth even if the maximum level of ionization ever produced is of the order of\n$10^{-2}$. In order to match the cosmic microwave background polarization power\nspectrum, other significant sources of reionization are needed at low redshift.\nDecaying particles producing a ionization fraction $x \\simeq 0.5$ at $z \\simeq\n20$ would imply an optical depth much too high to fit the cosmic microwave\nbackground spectra at $l \\ge 30$.

The Casimir\nforce between an Au-coated sphere and a Cu-coated plate of a\nmicroelectromechanical torsional oscillator was measured statically with an\nabsolute error of 0.3 pN. In addition, the Casimir pressure between two\nparallel plates was determined dynamically with an absolute error of $\\approx\n0.6$ mPa. Within the limits of experimental and theoretical errors, the results\nare in agreement with a theory that takes into account the finite conductivity\nand roughness of the two metals. The level of agreement between experiment and\ntheory was then used to set limits on the predictions of extra-dimensional\nphysics and thermal quantum field theory. It is shown that two theoretical\napproaches to the thermal Casimir force which predict effects linear in\ntemperture are ruled out by these experiments. Finally, constraints on Yukawa\ncorrections to Newton's law of gravity are strengthened by more than an order\nof magnitude in the range 56 nm to 330 nm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Oct 2003 00:47:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Nevertheless, nuclei\nperform an unexpected auto-reverse motion: when a migrating nucleus approaches\nthe leading edge, it decelerates, changes the direction of motion and\naccelerates to move toward the other end of the elongated cell.

Based on comparative neuroanatomical data, it is found, surprisingly,\nthat this connectivity is either only weakly dependent or independent of brain\nsize. It is discussed how this formula can be used to estimate the average\nlength of axons in white matter. Other allometric relations, such as cortical\npatches and area sizes vs. brain size, are also provided. Finally, some\nfunctional implications, with an emphasis on efficient cortical computation,\nare discussed as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Oct 2003 01:58:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In Dictyostelium\ndiscoideum the transition involves a change in the rate of contraction, and\noccurs when the width of the cleavage furrow is comparable to the height of the\ncell. In Entamoeba invadens the contractile ring carries the cell through the\nfirst phase, but cannot complete the second stage of cytokinesis.

In one case, a common particle position measuring situation, the\napparatus evolves to a superposition of macroscopically distinguishable states\n(does not collapse to one of them as it should) because each such\nparticle/apparatus/environment state has precisely the same energy spectrum.\nSecond, assuming an experiment takes place involving collapse to one of two\npossible outcomes which is permanently recorded, it is shown in general that\nthis can only happen in the unlikely case that the two apparatus states\ncorresponding to the two outcomes have disjoint energy spectra. Next, the\nprogressive narrowing of the energy spectrum due to the collapse mechanism is\nconsidered. This has the effect of broadening the time evolution of objects as\nthe universe evolves. Two examples, one involving a precessing spin, the other\ninvolving creation of an excited state followed by its decay, are presented in\nthe form of paradoxes. In both examples, the microscopic behavior predicted by\nstandard quantum theory is significantly altered under energy-driven collapse,\nbut this alteration is not observed by an apparatus when it is included in the\nquantum description. The resolution involves recognition that the statevector\ndescribing the apparatus does not collapse, but evolves to a superposition of\nmacroscopically different states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Oct 2003 16:12:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The first method uses the concept of a reference system --\nin a world subject to a superselection rule, unrestricted operations can be\nsimulated by parties who share access to a reference system with suitable\nproperties. By this method, we prove that if an n-party protocol is secure in a\nworld subject to a superselection rule, then the security is maintained even if\nthe superselection rule is relaxed. However, the proof applies only to a\nlimited class of superselection rules, those in which the superselection\nsectors are labeled by unitary irreducible representations of a compact\nsymmetry group. The second method uses the concept of the format of a message\nsent between parties -- by verifying the format, the recipient of a message can\ncheck whether the message could have been sent by a party who performed\ncharge-conserving operations. By this method, we prove that protocols subject\nto general superselection rules (including those pertaining to nonabelian\nanyons in two dimensions) are no more secure than protocols in the unrestricted\nworld. However, the proof applies only to two-party protocols.
