The most prominent\nexample is the Moore-Read model for the $\\nu=5/2$ state, in which the ground\nstate is a superconductor of composite fermions, and the charged excitations\nare vortices in that superconductor. In this paper we develop a physical\npicture of the nonabelian statistics of these vortices. Considering first the\npositions of the vortices as fixed, we define a set of single-particle states\nat and near the core of each vortex, and employ general properties of the\ncorresponding Bogolubov-deGennes equations to write the ground states in the\nFock space defined by these single-particle states. We find all ground states\nto be entangled superpositions of all possible occupations of the\nsingle-particle states near the vortex cores, in which the probability for all\noccupations is equal, and the relative phases vary from one ground state to\nanother. Then, we examine the evolution of the ground states as the positions\nof the vortices are braided. We find that as vortices move, they accumulate a\ngeometric phase that depends on the occupations of the single-particle states\nnear the cores of other vortices. Thus, braiding of vortices changes the\nrelative phase between different components of a superposition, in which the\noccupations of the single-particle states differ, and hence transform the\nsystem from one ground state to another. These transformations are the source\nof the nonabelian statistics. Finally, by exploring a \"self-similar\" form of\nthe many-body wave functions of the ground states, we show the equivalence of\nour picture and pictures derived previously, in which vortex braiding seemingly\naffects the occupations of states in the cores of the vortices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Oct 2003 15:10:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-12"}

An\napplication of projection operator technique available in the literature is\nused for this purpose. It is argued that the hydrodynamic velocity defined\nthere, in situations where the fluid is turbulent, is to be interpreted as the\nmean velocity field; in that case, the momentum component of the generalized\ntransport equation derived there is the mean velocity equation. In this paper,\nstationary incompressible flow for constant mass density and temperature is\nconsidered. The stress tensor is obtained as a nonlinear functional of the mean\nvelocity field, the linear part of which is the Stokes tensor. The formula\ncontains a time correlation function in local equilibrium. Presently, there\nexists a microscopic theory for time correlations in total equilibrium only.\nFor this reason and as a preliminary measure, the formula has been expanded\ninto a power series in the mean velocity; though this limits the applicability\nto low Reynolds number flow. The second order term has been evaluated in a\nformer paper of the author. For the third order term, the form of the kernel\nfunction is derived. Its calculation with the aid of the mode-coupling theory\nis completed; it will be reported in an separate paper.

Bohr\nargued that distinguishing between two slits a distance s apart gives the\nparticle a random momentum transfer \\wp of order h/s. This was accepted for\nmore than 60 years, until Scully, Englert and Walther (SEW) proposed a\nwhich-way scheme that, they claimed, entailed no momentum transfer. Storey,\nTan, Collett and Walls (STCW) in turn proved a theorem that, they claimed,\nshowed that Bohr was right. This work reviews and extends a recent proposal\n[Wiseman, Phys. Lett. A 311, 285 (2003)] to resolve the issue using a\nweak-valued probability distribution for momentum transfer, P_wv(\\wp). We show\nthat P_wv(\\wp) must be wider than h/6s. However, its moments can still be zero\nbecause P_wv(\\wp) is not necessarily positive definite. Nevertheless, it is\nmeasurable in a way understandable to a classical physicist. We introduce a new\nmeasure of spread for P_wv(\\wp): half of the unit-confidence interval, and\nconjecture that it is never less than h/4s. For an idealized example with\ninfinitely narrow slits, the moments of P_wv(\\wp) and of the momentum\ndistributions are undefined unless a process of apodization is used. We show\nthat by considering successively smoother initial wave functions, successively\nmore moments of both P_wv(\\wp) and the momentum distributions become defined.\nFor this example the moments of P_wv(\\wp) are zero, and these are equal to the\nchanges in the moments of the momentum distribution. We prove that this\nrelation holds for schemes in which the moments of P_wv(\\wp) are non-zero, but\nonly for the first two moments. We also compare these moments to those of two\nother momentum-transfer distributions and \\hat{p}_f-\\hat{p}_i. We find\nagreement between all of these, but again only for the first two moments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Oct 2003 07:45:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
