Reducing the number of model-dependent assumptions to a minimum, we\ndiscuss the observability of these sources with existing and planned\ntelescopes. We define a family of models characterized by two parameters: the\nLyman continuum escape fraction f_c from the sources, and the clumpiness\nparameter C of the intergalactic medium. The minimum surface brightness model\ncorresponds to a value of unity for both parameters.

Mass models of disk galaxies have well-known degeneracies, that prevent\na unique mass decomposition.

Our full set of constraints\nconsists of mass-to-light (M/L) ratios from stellar population synthesis models\nbased on B-R colors, constraints on halo parameters from N-body simulations,\nand constraining the halo virial velocity to be less than the maximum observed\nvelocity. These constraints are only partially successful in lifting the\ncusp-core degeneracy. The effect of adiabatic contraction of the halo by the\ndisk is to steepen cores into cusps and reduce the best-fit halo concentration\nand M/L values (often significantly).

Such differential rotation results from the redistribution of\nangular momentum by the nonlinear convection that strongly senses the overall\nrotation of the star. Penetrative convective motions extend into the overlying\nradiative zone, yielding a prolate shape (aligned with the rotation axis) to\nthe central region in which nearly adiabatic stratification is achieved. This\nis further surrounded by a region of overshooting motions, the extent of which\nis greater at the equator than at the poles, yielding an overall spherical\nshape to the domain experiencing at least some convective mixing. We assess the\novershooting achieved as the stability of the radiative exterior is varied, and\nthe weak circulations that result in that exterior. The convective plumes serve\nto excite gravity waves in the radiative envelope, ranging from localized\nripples of many scales to some remarkable global resonances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Sep 2003 20:02:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The properties of the 4-th generation of fermions are the same as\nthat of the ordinary-matter fermions in first three generations except for the\nfamily charge of the SU(4)_F group: F=(1/3,1/3,1/3,-1), where F=1/3 for\nfermions of ordinary matter and F=-1 for the 4-th generation. The difference in\nF does not allow the mixing between ordinary and fourth-generation fermions.\nBecause of the conservation of the F charge, the creation of baryons and\nleptons in the process of electroweak baryogenesis must be accompanied by the\ncreation of fermions of the 4-th generation. As a result the excess n_B of\nbaryons over antibaryons leads to the excess n_{\\nu 4}=N-\\bar N=n_B of\nneutrinos over antineutrinos in the 4-th generation. This massive\nfourth-generation neutrino may form the non-baryonic dark matter. In principle\ntheir mass density n_{\\nu 4}m_N in the Universe can give the main contribution\nto the dark matter, since the lower bound on neutrino mass m_N from the data on\ndecay of the Z-bosons is m_N > m_Z/2. The straightforward prediction of this\nmodel leads to the amount of cold dark matter relative to baryons, which is an\norder of magnitude bigger than allowed by observations. This inconsistency may\nbe avoided by non-conservation of the F-charge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Oct 2003 06:43:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Oct 2003 13:02:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2003 14:25:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 30 Oct 2003 14:10:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The experimental spectrum obtained with the PA\nlaser tuned closed to the $2^3S_1\\leftrightarrow 2^3P_0$ atomic line has been\nreported in a previous Letter. Here, we first focus on the corrections to be\napplied to the measured resonance frequencies in order to infer the molecular\nbinding energies. We then present a calculation of the vibrational spectra for\nthe purely long-range molecular states, using adiabatic potentials obtained\nfrom perturbation theory. With retardation effects taken into account, the\nagreement between experimental and theoretical determinations of the spectrum\nfor the $0_u^+$ purely long-range potential well is very good. The results\nyield a determination of the lifetime of the $2^3P$ atomic state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Oct 2003 12:36:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
