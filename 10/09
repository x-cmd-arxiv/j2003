The merger history of dark halos and associated IMBHs is followed by\nMonte Carlo realizations of the merger hierarchy in a LCDM cosmology.

We show that the pinning force density Fp exhibits a rich and\ncomplex anisotropic behavior that sharply contrast with the small mass\nanisotropy of these compounds. For magnetic fields H applied parallel to the\ncrystallographic c-axis, the first order reorientation transition between two\nrhombic lattices manifests itself as a kink in Fp(H). For H perpendicular to\nthe c-axis, a much larger Fp(H) and a slower relaxation rate is observed. In\nthis field configuration, nonlocality induces a fourfold periodicity in Fp when\nH is rotated within the square basal plane. Unlike the out-of-plane anisotropy,\nwhich persists for increasing impurity levels, the in-plane fourfold anisotropy\ncan be strongly suppressed by reducing the electronic mean free path. This\nresult unambiguously demonstrate that the in-plane anisotropy is a consequence\nof nonlocal effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Oct 2003 17:55:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Oct 2003 05:49:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

One can\ndistinguish between two classes of generalized defects: those which do not\naffect the finite-size integrability of the Ising chain, and on the other hand\nthose that destroy this property. In this context, finite-size integrability is\nalways understood as a synonym for the possibility to write the Hamiltonian of\nthe finite chain as a bilinear expression in fermionic operators by means of a\nJordan-Wigner transformation. Concerning the first type of defect, an exact\nsolution for the scaling spectrum is obtained for the most universal defect\nthat preserves the global Z_2 symmetry of the chain.

It is demonstrated that the correlations\nbetween arbitrarily far-apart regions of the vacuum of a relativistic free\nscalar field cannot be reproduced by a local hidden-variable model, and that as\na function of the distance L between the regions, the entanglement decreases at\na slower rate than exp(-(L/cT)^3).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Oct 2003 13:35:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2004 16:05:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
