Requiring the rate of stellar mass\ncapture to equal the mass accretion rate into the black hole, a relation\nbetween the black hole mass and the stellar velocity dispersion is predicted of\nthe form M_{BH} \\propto sigma_*^{30/7}. The normalization depends on various\nuncertain parameters such as the disk viscosity, but is consistent with\nobservation for reasonable assumptions. We show that a seed central black hole\nin a newly formed stellar system can grow at the Eddington rate up to this\npredicted mass via stellar captures by the accretion disk. Once this mass is\nreached, star captures are insufficient to maintain an Eddington accretion\nrate, and the quasar may naturally turn off as the accretion switches to a\nlow-efficiency advection mode. The model provides a mechanism to deliver mass\nto the accretion disk at small radius, probably solving the problem of\ngravitational instability to star formation in the disk at large radius. We\nnote that the matter from stars that is incorporated to the disk has an average\nspecific angular momentum that is very small or opposite to that of the disk,\nand discuss how a rotating disk may be maintained as it captures this matter if\na small fraction of the accreted mass comes from stellar winds that form a disk\nextending to larger radius.

Some of these methods can be classified as\ndivergence-cleaning schemes, where one evolves the magnetic field components\njust like any other variable in a higher order Godunov scheme. The fact that\nthe magnetic field is divergence-free is imposed post-facto via a\ndivergence-cleaning step. Other schemes for evolving the magnetic field rely on\na staggered mesh formulation which is inherently divergence-free. The claim has\nbeen made that the two approaches are equivalent. In this paper we\ncross-compare three divergence-cleaning schemes based on scalar and vector\ndivergence-cleaning and a popular divergence-free scheme. All schemes are\napplied to the same stringent test problem. Several deficiencies in all the\ndivergence-cleaning schemes become clearly apparent with the scalar\ndivergence-cleaning schemes performing worse than the vector\ndivergence-cleaning scheme. The vector divergence-cleaning scheme also shows\nsome deficiencies relative to the staggered mesh divergence-free scheme. The\ndifferences can be explained by realizing that all the divergence-cleaning\nschemes are based on a Poisson solver which introduces a non-locality into the\nscheme, though other subtler points of difference are also catalogued.

In a long annular JJ, the dipole generates free\nfluxon(s) if the bias current density exceeds the critical value.

An important\ningredient is a simplified state-estimation algorithm, necessary for a\nreal-time implementation of the feedback loop.
