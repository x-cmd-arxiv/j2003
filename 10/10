The main point of this crisis\nis that number of substructures presented by cosmological N-body simulations\nbased on CDM scenario for structure formation is much larger than observed\nsubstructures. Therefore, it is crucial for this crisis to discriminate whether\nexpected number of CDM substructures really exist but non-luminous or do not\nexist.\n  In this paper, we present a new idea to detect such invisible substructures\nby utilizing a gravitational lensing. Here, we consider quasars that are\ngravitationally lensed by a foreground galaxy. A substructure around the\nlensing galaxy may superposed on one of the lensed images of such quasars. In\nthis situation, additional image splitting should occur in the image behind the\nsubstructure, and further multiple images are created. This is ``quasar\nmesolensing''.\n  We estimate separation and time delay between further multiple images due to\nquasar mesolensing. The expected value is $1 \\sim 30$ milli-arcsecond for the\nseparation and future fine resolution imaging enable us to find invisible\nsubstructures, and is $1 \\sim 10^3$ second for the time delay and high-speed\nmonitoring of such quasar will be able to find ``echo''-like variation due to\nquasar mesolensing in intrinsic variability of the quasar. Furthermore, we\nevaluate that the optical depth for the quasar mesolensing is $\\sim 0.1$.\nConsequently, if we monitor a few multiple quasars, we can find ``echo''-like\nvariation in one of the images after intrinsic flux variations of quasars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Oct 2003 13:58:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

Success in state targeting can be described as having\nsome control over the outcome of the test. We show that increasing one's\ncontrol above a minimum amount implies an unavoidable increase in the\nprobability of failing the test. This is analogous to the unavoidable\ndisturbance to a quantum state that results from gaining information about its\nidentity, and can be shown to be a purely quantum effect. We provide some\napplications of the results to the security analysis of cryptographic tasks\nimplemented between remote antagonistic parties. Although we focus on weak coin\nflipping, the results are significant for other two-party protocols, such as\nstrong coin flipping, partially binding and concealing bit commitment, and bit\nescrow. Furthermore, the results have significance not only for the traditional\nnotion of security in cryptography, that of restricting a cheater's ability to\nbias the outcome of the protocol, but also on a novel notion of security that\narises only in the quantum context, that of cheat-sensitivity.
