Analysed within the context of\nstandard models for the chemical evolution of the solar vicinity, this drop\nresults from the metallicity dependence of the C yields from massive stars with\nmass loss, augmented by the delayed release of C from stars of low and\nintermediate mass. The former is, however, always the dominant factor. Our\nsurvey has also uncovered tentative evidence to suggest that, as the oxygen\nabundance decreases below [O/H] = -1, [C/O] may not remain constant at [C/O] =\n-0.5, as previously thought, but increase again, possibly approaching\nnear-solar values at the lowest metallicities ([O/H] approximately equal to\n-3).

The new analysis produced light\ncurves and periods for 15 variables, bringing to 222 the total number of RR\nLyrae stars in CC01 M3 dataset. We have identified three new candidate\ndouble-mode (RRd) variables (V13, V200, and V251) in M3. Of the newly\ndiscovered RRd's V13 is unusual in that it has the fundamental as the dominant\npulsation mode. Two of the new candidate RRd's (V13 and V200) have period\nratios as low as 0.738-0.739. They lie separated from all previously known\nRRd's in the Petersen diagram, in positions implying a large spread in mass\nand/or, less likely, in heavy element mass fraction, among the M3 horizontal\nbranch (HB) stars. We explore mass transfer and helium enhancement as possible\nexplanations for the apparent spread in HB masses. We also note that the masses\nderived from the RRd analyses now favor little mass loss on the red giant\nbranch. V200 has changed its dominant pulsation mode from fundamental to first\novertone, while V251 has changed its dominant mode from first overtone to\nfundamental in the interval 1992 to 1993. Together with M3-V166 this is the\nfirst time that RRd variables are observed to switch their dominant pulsation\nmodes while remaining RRd's. The phenomenon is found to occur in a one year\ntime-span thus suggesting that these stars are undergoing a rapid evolutionary\nphase, and that both redward and blueward evolution may take place among the HB\nstars in M3. The unusual behavior of the M3 RRd's is discussed and compared to\nthat of the RRd's identified so far in globular clusters and in the field of\nour and other Local Group galaxies.

In systems of Maxwell particles the collision\nfrequency is independent of the relative velocity of the colliding particles,\nand in hard sphere systems it is linear. We then demonstrate the existence of\nscaling solutions for the velocity distribution function, $F(v,t) \\sim\nv_0(t)^{-d} f((v/v_0(t))$, where $v_0$ is the r.m.s. velocity. The scaling form\n$f(c)$ shows overpopulation in the high energy tails. In the case of freely\ncooling systems the tails are of algebraic form, $ f(c)\\sim c^{-d-a}$, where\nthe exponent $a$ may or may not depend on the degree of inelasticity, and in\nthe case of forced systems the tails are of stretched Gaussian type\n$f(v)\\sim\\exp[-\\beta (v/v_0)^b]$ with $b <2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Oct 2003 08:39:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Feb 2004 16:06:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This class of models can\nbe formulated to a very good approximation in terms of 11 parameters: 4\nparameters of the CKM matrix and 7 values of the {\\it universal} master\nfunctions $F_r$ that parametrize the short distance contributions. In a given\nMFV model, $F_r$ can be calculated in perturbation theory and are generally\ncorrelated with each other but in a model independent analysis they must be\nconsidered as free parameters. We conjecture that only 5 or even only 4 of\nthese functions receive significant new physics contributions. We summarize the\nstatus of the CKM matrix, outline strategies for the determination of the\nvalues of $F_r$ and present a number of relations between physical observables\nthat do not depend on $F_r$ at all. We emphasize that the formulation of MFV in\nterms of master functions allows to study transparently correlations between\n$B$ and $K$ decays which is very difficult if Wilson coefficients normalized at\nlow energy scales are used instead. We discuss briefly a specific MFV model:\nthe Standard Model with one universal large extra dimension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Oct 2003 11:54:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-06"}

The size distribution of ice crystals has been measured at selected\ndepths in the upper 880 m of the NorthGRIP ice core (Svensson and others,\n2003b), which covers a time span of 5300 years. The distributions change with\ntime toward a universal curve, indicating a common underlying physical process\nin the formation of crystals. We identify this process as an interplay between\nfragmentation of the crystals and diffusion of their grain boundaries. The\nprocess is described by a two-parameter differential equation to which we\nobtain the exact solution. The solution is in excellent agreement with the\nexperimentally observed distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Oct 2003 12:57:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Jan 2004 13:26:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

For the folded states, whose interiors are densely packed,\nthe radii of gyration (Rg) and these two parameters are calculated using the\ncoordinates of the experimentally determined structures. Although Rg scales as\nexpected for maximally compact structures, the distributions of the shape\nparameters show that there is considerable asymmetry in the shapes of folded\nstructures. The degree of asymmetry is greater for proteins that form\noligomers. Analysis of the two- and three-body contacts in the native\nstructures shows that the presence of near equal number of contacts between\nbackbone and side-chains and between side-chains gives rise to dense packing.\nWe suggest that proteins with relatively large values of shape parameters can\ntolerate volume mutations without greatly affecting the network of contacts or\ntheir stability. To probe shape characteristics of denatured states we have\ndeveloped a model of a WW-like domain. The shape parameters, which are\ncalculated using Langevin simulations, change dramatically in the course of\ncoil to globule transition. Comparison of the values of shape parameters\nbetween the globular state and the folded state of WW domain shows that both\nenergetic (especially dispersion in the hydrophobic interactions) and steric\neffects are important in determining packing in proteins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Oct 2003 22:40:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
