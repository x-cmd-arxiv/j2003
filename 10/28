We are able to\ndescribe the morphology of the HVS in more detail than ever before. We present\nan HST image for comparison, and note close correspondence between the deepest\nX-ray absorption and the optical absorption. A column density map of the HVS\nshows an average column density NH of 1x10^21 cm^-2 with a range from ~5x10^20\nto 5x10^21 cm^-2. From the NH map we calculate a total mass for the absorbing\ngas in the HVS of (1.32+-0.05)x10^9 solar masses at solar abundance. 75 per\ncent of the absorbing mass is contained in the four regions of deepest\nabsorption. We examine temperature maps produced by spectral fitting and find\nno direct evidence for shocked gas in the HVS. Using deprojection methods and\nthe depth of the observed absorption, we are able to put a lower limit on the\ndistance of the HVS from the nucleus of 57 kpc, showing that the HVS is quite\nseparate from the body of NGC 1275.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Oct 2003 10:56:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-17"}

Many of the scenarios we examine involve highly-relativistic flows that\nrequire improvements upon previously published numerical methods to simulate.\nHere our particular focus is on the physical behavior of the coupled\nfluid-gravitational system at the threshold of black hole formation--so-called\nblack hole critical phenomena. To investigate such phenomena starting from\nconditions representing stable stars, we must drive the star far from its\ninitial stable configuration. We use one of two different mechanisms to do\nthis: setting the initial velocity profile of the star to be in-going, or\ncollapsing a shell of massless scalar field onto the star. Both of these\napproaches give rise to a large range of dynamical scenarios that the star may\nfollow. These scenarios have been extensively surveyed by using different\ninitial star solutions, and by varying either the magnitude of the velocity\nprofile or the amplitude of the scalar field pulse.

The appeal of this\nproposal is that these features are a manifestation of the non-perturbative\nsector of the SM, requiring no assumptions about new physics beyond presently\nattainable experimental limits. In this thesis we apply non-perturbative\ntechniques to two complementary models: a toy 4-fermion model containing\nexplicit chiral symmetry-breaking terms and the quenched hypercharge gauge\ninteraction. Understanding of how fermion mass, generations and CP-violation\nmight arise is first investigated in the toy 4-fermion model. It is shown that\ndifferent scale-invariant 4-fermion operators are present for the three\nsubspaces of the full theory, enabling self-consistent introduction of three\nfermion generations. The second part of the thesis is concerned with dynamical\nfermion mass generation in the quenched hypercharge interaction. In particular\nwe follow the successful procedure developed for QED, developing a 1-loop\nrenormalisable vertex {\\it ansatz} for solution of the fermion self-energy\nDyson-Schwinger equation. We find two mass \"gaps\", possibly corresponding to\ntwo types of scalar 4-fermion pairing. These \"gaps\" cannot, however, be\ninterpreted as physical fermion mass. An alternative possibility, that of a\nrearrangement of fermionic degrees of freedom analogous to spin-charge\nseparation in condensed matter physics, is also briefly outlined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Oct 2003 10:17:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In\nthis paper, a subtle effective description avoiding the problem is presented in\na first quantized language, consistent with experiments and the Equivalence\nPrinciple. First quantization allows a minimal domain of validity to be carved\nout by cutting on the proper length of particle worldlines. This is facilitated\nby working in (locally) Euclidean spacetime, although considerations of\nunitarity are still addressed by analytic continuation from Lorentzian\nspacetime. The new effective description demonstrates that the cosmological\nconstant problem {\\it is} sensitive to short-distance details of gravity, which\ncan be probed experimentally. ``Fat Gravity'' toy models are presented,\nillustrating how gravity might shut off at short but testable distances, in a\ngenerally covariant manner that suppresses the cosmological constant. This\npaper improves on previous work by allowing generalizations to massless matter,\nnon-trivial spins, non-perturbative phenomena, and multiple (metastable) vacua.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Oct 2003 20:20:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-15"}
