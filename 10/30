This study is\nmotivated by both observational and theoretical work that indicate the presence\nof large amounts of gas in the central regions of merging galaxies. N-body\nsimulations have shown that the coalescence of a massive black hole binary\neventually stalls in a stellar background. However, our simulations suggest\nthat the massive black hole binary will finally merge if it is embedded in a\ngaseous background. Here we present results in which the gas is assumed to be\ninitially spherical with a relatively smooth distribution. In the early\nevolution of the binary, the separation dimishes due to the gravitational drag\nexerted by the background gas. In the later stages, when the binary dominates\nthe gravitational potential in its vicinity, the medium responds by forming an\nellipsoidal density enhancement whose axis lags behind the binary axis, and\nthis offset produces a torque on the binary that causes continuing loss of\nangular momentum and is able to reduce the binary separation to distances where\ngravitational radiation is efficient. Assuming typical parameters from\nobservations of Ultra Luminous Infrared Galaxies, we predict that a black hole\nbinary will merge within $10^{7}$yrs; therefore these results imply that in a\nmerger of gas-rich galaxies, any massive central black holes will coalescence\nsoon after the galaxies merge. Our work thus supports scenarios of massive\nblack hole evolution and growth where hierarchical merging plays an important\nrole. The final coalescence of the black holes leads to gravitational radiation\nemission that would be detectable up to high redshift by LISA. We show that\nsimilar physical effects are important for the formation of close binary stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Oct 2003 23:20:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Nov 2003 15:56:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The domain walls are made of\nperfectly straight segments, and domain growth appears frozen within the time\nscales studied with Monte Carlo simulations. This dynamical obstruction has its\norigin in the topology of the allowed reconfigurations in phase space, which\nconsist of updates of closed loops of spins.

Analytical expressions of the dHvA Fourier amplitudes are derived\nin the case where the total number of electron is fixed (Canonical Ensemble,\nCE). As already reported in the literature, the oscillations of the chemical\npotential yield frequency mixing and Lifshitz-Kosevich (LK) theory, which is\nvalid in the Grand Canonical Ensemble (GCE), does not apply at very low\ntemperature.

The orbits of the\ninspiraling COs are highly complicated; they can remain rather eccentric up\nuntil the final plunge, and display extreme versions of relativistic perihelion\nprecession and Lense-Thirring precession of the orbital plane. The strongest\ncapture signals will be ~10 times weaker than LISA's instrumental noise, but in\nprinciple (with sufficient computing power) they can be disentangled from the\nnoise by matched filtering. The associated template waveforms are not yet in\nhand, but theorists will very likely be able to provide them before LISA\nlaunches.

Our model waveforms include most of\nthe key qualitative features of true waveforms, and cover the full space of\ncapture-event parameters (including orbital eccentricity and the MBH's spin).\nHere we use our approximate waveforms to (i) estimate the relative\ncontributions of different harmonics (of the orbital frequency) to the total\nsignal-to-noise ratio, and (ii) estimate the accuracy with which LISA will be\nable to extract the physical parameters of the capture event from the measured\nwaveform. For a typical source (a $10 M_\\odot$ CO captured by a $10^6 M_\\odot$\nMBH at a signal-to-noise ratio of 30), we find that LISA can determine the MBH\nand CO masses to within a fractional error of $\\sim 10^{-4}$, measure $S/M^2$\n(where $S$ and $M$ are the MBH's mass and spin) to within $\\sim 10^{-4}$, and\ndetermine the sky location of the source to within $\\sim 10^{-3}$ stradians.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Oct 2003 01:27:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Jan 2004 20:38:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2004 09:29:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Here turbulence is defined to be a phenomenon of random\nvelocity field in the space-time continuum accompanied by chaotic occurrence of\nvortices. This interpretation is independent of the Navier-Stokes equations. I\nhave reasoned how individual fluid percels are disintegrated with increasing\nReynolds number (Re) (or increasing velocity or decreasing viscosity or both)\nleading to creation of smaller parcels with arbitrary speeds in arbitrary\ndirections, which destroys the laminar structure of the fluid flow. I have\nmodeled the occurrence of a vortex as a result of collision among fluid jets\nunder certain conditions. Chaotic occurrence of such vortices further\nrandomizes the velocity field. These together ultimately lead to turbulence. I\nhave also shown an application of vortex formation in a dynamic fluid in\natmospheric science., where it has been shown how an initial dusturbing\ncyclonic vortex is created by collision between two linear wind jets under\ncertain conditions, which under favorable conditions, may mature into a severe\ntropical storm. Then a three dimensional mathematical modeling of the vortex\n(assuming that it is going to become a matured storm) has been proposed with\ncomputer simulations. This helps us to understand the mystery of origin of\ncyclonic and anticyclonic vortices in atmosphere and some of their observed\nasymmetries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Oct 2003 12:04:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

For a N electrons system with Heisenberg exchange\nintegral, the correct exchange Hamilton should be of two terms, not only one as\nin the previous magnetism theories.

Based on the principle of superposition of state, the\neigenstate of the system with Heisenberg exchange integral, the sum of a\npositive term and a negative term, and the energy (relative to exchange\ninteraction) eigenvalue were attained.
