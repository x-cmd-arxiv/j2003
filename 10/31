Potential efficiency benefits from TR\non these meshes are seen to be quite limited except in the case of refining a\nsmall number of points on a large mesh -- in this case, the benefit can be made\narbitrarily large, albeit at the expense of spatial refinement efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Oct 2003 02:29:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In this\npaper, we present our experiences designing and implementing MPICH2 over\nInfiniBand. Because of its high performance and open standard, InfiniBand is\ngaining popularity in the area of high-performance computing. Our study focuses\non optimizing the performance of MPI-1 functions in MPICH2. One of our\nobjectives is to exploit Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) in Infiniband to\nachieve high performance. We have based our design on the RDMA Channel\ninterface provided by MPICH2, which encapsulates architecture-dependent\ncommunication functionalities into a very small set of functions. Starting with\na basic design, we apply different optimizations and also propose a\nzero-copy-based design. We characterize the impact of our optimizations and\ndesigns using microbenchmarks. We have also performed an application-level\nevaluation using the NAS Parallel Benchmarks. Our optimized MPICH2\nimplementation achieves 7.6 $\\mu$s latency and 857 MB/s bandwidth, which are\nclose to the raw performance of the underlying InfiniBand layer. Our study\nshows that the RDMA Channel interface in MPICH2 provides a simple, yet\npowerful, abstraction that enables implementations with high performance by\nexploiting RDMA operations in InfiniBand. To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first high-performance design and implementation of MPICH2 on InfiniBand\nusing RDMA support.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Oct 2003 18:11:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The computational identification of such motifs is made easier\nby the fact that they often appear several times in the upstream region of the\nregulated genes, so that the number of occurrences of relevant motifs is often\nsignificantly larger than expected by pure chance. RESULTS: To exploit this\nfact, we construct sets of genes characterized by the statistical\noverrepresentation of a certain motif in their upstream regions. Then we study\nthe functional characterization of these sets by analyzing their annotation to\nGene Ontology terms. For the sets showing a statistically significant specific\nfunctional characterization, we conjecture that the upstream motif\ncharacterizing the set is a binding site for a transcription factor involved in\nthe regulation of the genes in the set. CONCLUSIONS: The method we propose is\nable to identify many known binding sites in S. cerevisiae and new candidate\ntargets of regulation by known transcription factors. Its application to less\nwell studied organisms is likely to be valuable in the exploration of their\nregulatory interaction network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Oct 2003 12:34:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2005 15:35:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
