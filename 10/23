A\nfirst published analysis of this data set (Richer et al. 2002) produced the\nresult that the age of M4 is 12.7 +/- 0.7 Gyr (Hansen et al. 2002), thus\nsetting a robust lower limit to the age of the universe. In view of the great\nastronomical importance of getting this number right, we have subjected the\nsame data set to the simplest possible photometric analysis that completely\navoids uncertain assumptions about the origin of the detected sources. This\nanalysis clearly reveals both a thin main sequence, from which can be deduced\nthe deepest statistically complete mass function yet determined for a globular\ncluster, and a white dwarf (WD) sequence extending all the way down to the 5\nsigma detection limit at I~27. The WD sequence is abruptly terminated at\nexactly this limit as expected by detection statistics. Using our most recent\ntheoretical WD models (Prada Moroni & Straniero 2002) to obtain the expected WD\nsequence for different ages in the observed bandpasses, we find that the data\nso far obtained do not reach the peak of the WD luminosity function, thence\nonly allowing one to set a lower limit to the age of M4 of ~9 Gyr. Thus, the\nproblem of determining the absolute age of a globular cluster and, therefore,\nthe onset of GC formation with cosmologically significant accuracy remains\ncompletely open. Only observations several magnitudes deeper than the limit\nobtained so far would allow one to approach this objective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Oct 2003 16:14:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We focus on the images and radial profiles of the emission lines (Si\nK, Fe L, Fe K) and of the high energy continuum. Chiefly, the Fe L and Si K\nemission-line images are generally consistent with each other and the radial\nprofiles show that the Si K emission extends to a larger radius than the Fe L\nemission (distinctly in the southern part of the remnant). Therefore, in\ncontrast to Cas A, no inversion of the Si- and Fe-rich ejecta layers is\nobserved in Kepler. Moreover, the Fe K emission peaks at a smaller radius than\nthe Fe L emission, which implies that the temperature increases inwards in the\nejecta. The 4-6 keV high energy continuum map shows the same distribution as\nthe asymmetric emission-line images except in the southeast where there is a\nstrong additional emission. A two color image of the 4-6 keV and 8-10 keV high\nenergy continuum illustrates that the hardness variations of the continuum are\nweak all along the remnant except in a few knots.

These composites consist of a collection of gold\nnanoparticles (of radius 50 nm or less) which are bound together by links made\nup of DNA strands. In our structural model, the nanocomposite forms from a\nseries of Monte Carlo steps, each involving reaction-limited cluster-cluster\naggregation (RLCA) followed by dehybridization of the DNA links. These links\nform with a probability $p_{eff}$ which depends on temperature and particle\nradius $a$. The final structure depends on the number of monomers (i. e. gold\nnanoparticles) $N_m$, $T$, and the relaxation time. At low temperature, the\nmodel results in an RLCA cluster. But after a long enough relaxation time, the\nnanocomposite reduces to a compact, non-fractal cluster. We calculate the\noptical properties of the resulting aggregates using the Discrete Dipole\nApproximation. Despite the restructuring, the melting transition (as seen in\nthe extinction coefficient at wavelength 520 nm) remains sharp, and the melting\ntemperature $T_M$ increases with increasing $a$ as found in our previous\npercolation model. However, restructuring increases the corresponding link\nfraction at melting to a value well above the percolation threshold. Our\ncalculated extinction cross section agrees qualitatively with experiments on\ngold/DNA composites. It also shows a characteristic ``rebound effect,''\nresulting from incomplete relaxation, which has also been seen in some\nexperiments. We discuss briefly how our results relate to a possible sol-gel\ntransition in these aggregates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Oct 2003 18:10:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

As in the\nsimilar elastic case, the soft dissipative modes theoretically cause no\nresistance to flow, nullifying the corresponding components of viscous part of\nstress tensor, and do not contribute in the dissipation. Similarly to the\ntheories of nematic elastic solids, this effect is caused by a marginal\nthermodynamic stability. The analysis is trivialized in a specific rotating\northogonal coordinate system whose one axis is directed along the director. We\ndemonstrate that depending on closeness of material parameters to the marginal\nstability conditions, LEP CEs describe the entire variety of soft, semi-soft\nand harder behaviours of nematic viscous liquids. When the only shearing\ndissipative modes are soft, the viscous part of stress tensor is symmetric, and\nLEP CE for stress, scaled with isotropic viscosity is reduced to a\none-parametric, stress - strain rate anisotropic relation. When additionally\nthe elongation dissipative mode is also soft, this scaled relation has no\nadditional parameters and shows that the dissipation is always less than that\nin isotropic phase. Simple shearing and simple elongation flows illustrate\nthese effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Oct 2003 21:16:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Feng et\nal. have suggested that, at high ambient de Sitter temperature, the rate may be\nstrongly enhanced, due to large degeneracy factors associated with the number\nof light species living on the worldsheet. This might facilitate the quick\nrelaxation from a large effective cosmological constant down to the observed\nvalue. Here, we analyse this possibility in some detail. In four dimensions,\nand after the moduli are stabilized, branes interact via repulsive long range\nforces. Because of that, the Coleman-de Luccia (CdL) instanton for coincident\nbrane nucleation may not exist, unless there is some short range interaction\nwhich keeps the branes together. If the CdL instanton exists, we find that the\ndegeneracy factor depends only mildly on the ambient de Sitter temperature, and\ndoes not switch off even in the case of tunneling from flat space. This would\nresult in catastrophic decay of the present vacuum. If, on the contrary, the\nCdL instanton does not exist, coindident brane nucleation may still proceed\nthrough a \"static\" instanton, representing pair creation of critical bubbles --\na process somewhat analogous to thermal activation in flat space. In that case,\nthe branes may stick together due to thermal symmetry restoration, and the pair\ncreation rate depends exponentially on the ambient de Sitter temperature,\nswitching off sharply as the temperature approaches zero. Such static instanton\nmay be well suited for the \"saltatory\" relaxation scenario proposed by Feng et\nal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Oct 2003 20:46:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Nov 2003 19:58:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Such points of non-analyticity (or discontinuities) are\nincompatible with adiabaticity, so that information transfer must always be\naccompanied by a change in entropy: a dynamic reformulation of Landauer's\nPrinciple. In addition, since Brillouin proved that discontinuities cannot\ntravel faster than the speed of light c, this also implies that information\ncannot be transferred at superluminal speeds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Oct 2003 10:00:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
