We formulate the question of electromagnetic radiation in real\ntime as an initial value problem and consistently describe the virtual\nelectromagnetic dressing of the initial state. In the limit of slowly evolving\nsystems, we recover known expressions for the emission rates and work out the\nfirst correction to the static formulas in a systematic gradient expansion.\nFinally, we discuss the possible application of recently developed techniques\nin non-equilibrium quantum field theory to the problem of electromagnetic\nradiation. We argue, in particular, that the two-particle-irreducible (2PI)\neffective action formalism provides a powerful resummation scheme for the\ndescription of multiple scattering effects, such as the\nLandau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal suppression recently discussed in the context of\nequilibrium QCD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Oct 2003 16:41:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2004 15:54:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

M_{g,n} has boundary strata consisting of nodal curves. The fundamental\nclasses of these boundary strata may be linearly dependent in the Chow group\nA_*(M_{g,n}). Relations among these boundary strata can be found by exploiting\na localization trick involving stable maps to P^1. This note explains this\ntrick and applies it to give a new derivation of Getzler's relation among\ncodimension 2 boundary strata in M_{1,4}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Oct 2003 23:30:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Jun 2012 19:54:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-18"}

A formula for the radius of a charged particle is derived. The formula\npredicts the radius of the proton correctly. The radius of the electron turns\nout to be a surprising quantity that solves the existing problems of\nelectrodynamics, particularly the problem of the infinite self-force of the\nelectron. In addition, the classical radius of the electron (2.82fm) will prove\nto be not a \"radius\", but rather the mean distance through which the retarded\npotentials of the self-force act. An important conclusion is that there is no\ndeficiency in the classical Abraham-Lorentz model of the self-force, but rather\nthe problem lies with our intuitive understanding of what an elementary\nparticle is. Other important conclusions are also discussed, including a\nphysically sound explanation for why electric charges must be quantized (as\nopposed to Dirac's monopole theory).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Oct 2003 23:17:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Nov 2003 06:11:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 10 Oct 2004 00:12:06 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2009 19:15:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-16"}

However, at present, they are little used.\nThere are a number of reasons for this, but we believe this is in part due to\ninadequacies in the methodologies that have been used to evaluate such\nforecasts, leading to uncertainty as to whether the forecasts are really useful\nor not and making it hard to work out which forecasts are best. To remedy this\nsituation we describe a set of guidelines that we recommend should be followed\nwhen evaluating the skill of site-specific probabilistic medium range\ntemperature forecasts. If these guidelines are followed then the results of\nvalidation can be used directly by forecast users to make decisions about which\nforecasts to use. If they are not followed then the results of validation may\nbe interesting, but will not be practically useful for users. We find that none\nof the published studies that evaluate such forecasts fall within our\nguidelines, and that, as a result, none convey the information that the users\nneed to make appropriate decisions about which forecasts are best.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Oct 2003 08:18:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This process reduces the pure\nisotropic entangled EPR state to a mixed anisotropic state. Averaging over the\nensemble of states leads to correlations between separated particles that\nsatisfies Bell's inequalities. Applying disentanglement to EPR pairs of photons\nshows that entanglement is characterized by various two-particle symmetry\nproperties. These symmetry properties are destroyed by disentanglement but\nphoton helicity is conserved. This is sufficient to account for the\ncorrelations needed to resolve the EPR paradox. Apart from a numerical factor,\nthe functional form for the correlations due to entanglement and\ndisentanglement is identical, thereby making it difficult to distinguish\nbetween the two in the current experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Oct 2003 17:12:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
