However, when other possible properties of tensors, for example\ntrace-freeness, are taken into account, such identities may be heavily\ndisguised. Tensor identities of this kind were first considered by Lovelock,\nand later by Edgar and Hoeglund.\n  In this paper we continue their work. We obtain dimensionally dependent\nidentities for highly structured expressions of products of (2,2)-forms. For\ntensors possessing more symmetries, such as block symmetry W_{abcd} = W_{cdab},\nor the first Bianchi identity W_{a[bcd]} = 0, we derive identities for less\nstructured expressions.\n  These identities are important tools when studying super-energy tensors, and,\nin turn, deriving identities for them. As an application we are able to show\nthat the Bel-Robinson tensor, the super-energy tensor for the Weyl tensor,\nsatisfies the equation T_{abcy}T^{abcx} = 1/4g^{x}_{y}T_{abcd}T^{abcd} in four\ndimensions, irrespective of the signature of the space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Oct 2003 11:38:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

To answer this question we have measured the entropy\ndensities of primary structure and secondary structure sequences, and the local\ninter-sequence mutual information density. We find that the important\ninter-sequence interactions are short ranged, that correlations between\nneighboring amino acids are essentially uninformative, and that only 1/4 of the\ntotal information needed to determine the secondary structure is available from\nlocal inter-sequence correlations. Since the remaining information must come\nfrom non-local interactions, this observation supports the view that the\nmajority of most proteins fold via a cooperative process where secondary and\ntertiary structure form concurrently. To provide a more direct comparison to\nexisting secondary structure prediction methods, we construct a simple hidden\nMarkov model (HMM) of the sequences. This HMM achieves a prediction accuracy\ncomparable to other single sequence secondary structure prediction algorithms,\nand can extract almost all of the inter-sequence mutual information. This\nsuggests that these algorithms are almost optimal, and that we should not\nexpect a dramatic improvement in prediction accuracy.

As a result of this separation, it is possible to show analytically that\nthe quadratic increase in the variance of the quantum walker's position with\ntime is a direct consequence of the coherence of the quantum evolution. If the\nevolution is decoherent, as in the classical case, the variance is shown to\nincrease linearly with time, as expected. Furthermore we show that this system\nhas an evolution operator analogous to that of a resonant quantum kicked rotor.\nAs this rotator may be described through a quantum computational algorithm, one\nmay employ this algorithm to describe the time evolution of the quantum walker.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Oct 2003 13:58:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 2004 15:23:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
