We use 45.5 deg^2 of R_C band imaging data\nfrom the Red-Sequence Cluster Survey (RCS) and define a sample of 1.2\\times\n10^5 lenses with 19.5<R_C<21, and a sample of 1.5\\times 10^6 background\ngalaxies with 21.5<R<24. We constrain the power law scaling relations between\nthe $B$-band luminosity and the mass and size of the halo, and find that the\nresults are in excellent agreement with observed luminosity-line-width\nrelations. Under the assumption that the luminosity does not evolve with\nredshift, the best fit NFW model yields a mass M_{200}=(8.8\\pm0.7)\\times\n10^{11} h^{-1} Msun and a scale radius r_s=16.7^{+3.7}_{-3.0} h^{-1} kpc for a\ngalaxy with a fiducial luminosity of \\lumstar. The latter result is in\nexcellent agreement with predictions from numerical simulations for a halo of\nthis mass.

We find an average projected) halo ellipticity of <e_{\\rm\nhalo}>=0.20^{+0.04}_{-0.05}, in fair agreement with results from numerical\nsimulations of CDM. Alternative theories of gravity (without dark matter)\npredict an isotropic lensing signal, which is excluded with 99.5% confidence.\nHence, our results provide strong support for the existence of dark matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Oct 2003 15:35:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This thesis offers a compromise between the two\nconceptions: The spontaneous splitting of space-time in a \"universal time\" and\na \"absolute space\" in the sense of Newton is accepted, but this (1+3)-splitting\nwill receive the status of a dynamical object in the sense of Einstein. Herein,\nthe (large scale) dynamics of the (1+3) splitting is coupled only weakly to the\n(local) fluctuation of the matter density with the help of the Einsteinian\nequations, so that these will keep their validity, regarding the gravitational\nphenomena, in a bounded domain of space (planets, stars, galaxies). However, at\na cosmic scale, the properties of the universe as whole will be determined\nessentially from the selfdynamics of the space-time splitting.

The axial form factor in electron-nucleon scattering is complicated by\nthe presence of electro-weak radiative corrections that in principle need to be\ncalculated or separately measured, but this axial form factor is suppressed at\nforward angles. The neutrino data has no such complication. Hence the use of\nforward-angle parity-violating $\\vec{e}p$ data with $\\nu p$ and $\\bar{\\nu} p$\ndata allows the extraction of all three strange form factors: electric,\nmagnetic and axial ($G_E^s$, $G_M^s$, and $G_A^s$).

In contrary to the eta, omega and eta' single meson production\nstudies which clearly show the strong pp final state interaction (FSI), the\ncross section values obtained at COSY-11 and DISTO can be both described by a\nfit with a four-body phase space including the proton-proton final state\ninteraction as well as with one-meson exchange calculations neglecting FSI\neffects. Therefore, one might think about a compensation of the strong pp\ninteraction through a pK- FSI effect or an additional degree of freedom caused\nby the four-body final state. In the latter case, strong FSI effects can be\nexpected at Q-values very close to the K+K- production threshold.

We also\nidentify a particular dimensionless ratio of potential to kinetic energies as a\nkey coupling constant. This coupling establishes characteristic length and time\nscales for a large class of low energy quantum states, and it guides the choice\nof step sizes in numerical work. Using the BCH method in conjunction with an\nimaginary time rotation, we compute low energy eigenstates for several quantum\nsystems coupled to non-trivial background potentials.
