This SNR contains the 135 ms\npulsar, J1124-5916. We apply non-equilibrium ionization (NEI) models to the\ndata. By comparing the derived abundances with those predicted from\nnucleosynthesis models, we estimate a progenitor mass of 30-40 solar masses. We\nalso derive the intrinsic parameters of the supernova explosion such as its\nenergy, the age of the SNR, the blast wave velocity, and the swept-up mass. In\nthe Sedov interpretation, our estimated SNR age of 2,600 years is close to the\npulsar's characteristic age of 2,900 years. This confirms the pulsar/SNR\nassociation and relaxes the need for the pulsar to have a non-canonical value\nfor the braking index, a large period at birth or a large transverse velocity.\nWe discuss the properties of the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) in the light of the\nKennel and Coroniti model and estimate the pulsar wind magnetization parameter.\nWe also report the first evidence for steepening of the power law spectral\nindex with increasing radius from the pulsar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jan 2003 20:29:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We find that\nthe HI in the galaxy has a regular velocity field, consistent with rotational\nmotion. The implied kinematical major axis is well aligned with the major axis\nof both the HI and optical images. Cam B is the faintest known galaxy with such\nrelatively well behaved kinematics. From the HI velocity field we derive a\nrotation curve for the galaxy. The peak (inclination corrected) rotation\nvelocity is only 7km/s, comparable to the observed velocity dispersion. After\ncorrecting the observed rotation velocities for random motions (the \"asymmetric\ndrift\" correction) we find a corrected peak rotation velocity of ~ 20 km/s. On\nfitting mass models to corrected rotation curve we find that the kinematics of\nCam B is well fit with a modified isothermal halo with central density $\\rho_0$\napproximately 12.0 $M_\\odot$ pc$ ^{-3}$. This derived central density has only\na very weak dependence on the assumed M/L ratio of the stellar disk. We also\nfind that the corrected rotation curve cannot be fit with an NFW halo\nregardless of the assumed M/L ratio. We compile from the literature a sample of\ngalaxies with rotation curves obtained from HI synthesis observations. From\nthis sample (which has an absolute magnitude range of ~ 12) we find (i) that\nCam B lies on the Tully-Fisher relation defined by these galaxies, provided we\nuse the corrected rotation velocity, and (ii) a weak trend for increasing halo\ncentral density with decreasing galaxy size. Such a trend is expected in\nhierarchical models of halo formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jan 2003 11:24:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
