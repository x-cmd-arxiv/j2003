We systematically investigate the importance of the five\nmain evolutionary channels in which the sdB stars form after one or two\ncommon-envelope (CE) phases, one or two phases of stable Roche-lobe overflow\n(RLOF) or as the result of the merger of two helium white dwarfs (WD) (see Han\net al. 2002, Paper I). Our best BPS model can satisfactorily explain the main\nobservational characteristics of sdB stars, in particular their distributions\nin the orbital period - minimum companion mass diagram and in the effective\ntemperature - surface gravity diagram, their distributions of orbital period,\nlog (g theta^4), and mass function, their binary fraction and the fraction of\nsdB binaries with WD companions, their birthrates and their space density. We\nobtain a Galactic formation rate, a total number in the Galaxy, the intrinsic\nbinary fraction for sdB stars. We also predict a distribution of masses for sdB\nstars that is wider than is commonly assumed and that some sdB stars have\ncompanions of spectral type as early as B. The percentage of A type stars with\nsdB companions can in principle be used to constrain some of the important\nparameters in the binary evolution model. We conclude that (a) the first RLOF\nphase needs to be more stable than is commonly assumed; (b) mass transfer in\nthe first stable RLOF phase is non-conservative, and the mass lost from the\nsystem takes away a specific angular momentum similar to that of the system;\n(c) common-envelope ejection is very efficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jan 2003 16:50:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The process leading to this phenomenon resembles\nthe first order Fermi acceleration with the difference that the energy is\ntransported across the shock front by photons rather than protons. The\nreflection of the energy flux crossing the shock front in both directions is\ndue to photon-photon pair production and Compton scattering.

Different authors call this property particle, but according to the\nterminology of this hypothesis, the term full wave is used in this text. The\npresent article discusses the validity of the empty/full waves hypothesis. It\nis shown that the energy conservation principle imposes for a full wave a\ncontinuous trajectory from the source to the detector. That gives legitimacy to\nthe question -- in case the wave function consists in a couple of\nspace-separated branches -- which wave-packet was a full wave before the click\nin the detector, or, in other authors' terminology, where was the particle\nbefore the detector clicked. This question is a counterfactual question. In\nsome multi-particle experiments, e.g. Hardy's thought-experiment with an\nelectron and a positron, the combination of the empty/full waves hypothesis and\ncounterfactual reasoning leads to a contradiction with the predictions of the\nquantum theory.
