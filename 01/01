We present quantitative data of such an\nexperiment. The experimental control parameter is the ratio between the radius\nof the orifice and the radius of the beads. As this parameter is increased, the\njamming probability decreases. However, in the range of parameters explored, no\nevidence of criticality --in the sense of a jamming probability that becomes\ninfinitely small for a finite radius-- has been found. We draw instead a\ncomparison with a simple model that captures the main features of the\nphenomenon, namely, percolation in one dimension. The model gives indeed a\nphase transition, albeit a special one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jan 2003 15:57:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Jul 2003 15:24:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
