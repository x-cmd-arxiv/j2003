The majority of the\nvalues form a first plateau at [N/Si]=-0.82 (+/- 0.13) and about 25 % form a\nsecond plateau at [N/Si]= -1.45 (+/- 0.05). The high values are at the level of\nthe Blue Compact Dwarfs but they extend further towards lower metallicities.\nThe lower plateau is a new feature of DLAs with no other counterparts. The two\nplateaux are found for different values of the N abundance with the transition\nat [N/H] ~ -3.0. We argue that this results from the delayed release of N\nbetween massive and intermediate mass stars with the lower plateau produced by\nmassive stars (M> 8 M_sun) only, which accounts for the small dispersion. The\nsystems on the lower plateau are relatively young and imply a continuous\nformation of the DLAs. While the interpretation of the N/O in the DLAs needs to\nbe confirmed, these observations could ultimately prove crucial for the\ninterpretation of the early N nucleosynthesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2003 12:35:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

The basic astrometric observable of the\ninstrument is the pathlength delay, a measurement made by a combination of\ninternal metrology measurements that determine the distance the starlight\ntravels through the two arms of the interferometer and a measurement of the\nwhite light stellar fringe to find the point of equal pathlength. Because this\noperation requires a non--negligible integration time to accurately measure the\nstellar fringe position, the interferometer baseline vector is not stationary\nover this time period, as its absolute length and orientation are\ntime--varying. This conflicts with the consistency condition necessary for\nextracting the astrometric parameters which requires a stationary baseline\nvector. This paper addresses how the time-varying baseline is ``regularized''\nso that it may act as a single baseline vector for multiple stars, and thereby\nestablishing the fundamental operation of the instrument.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2003 01:11:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
