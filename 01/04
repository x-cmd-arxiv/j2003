Through deep spectroscopic and\nhigh-resolution imaging observations of some GRB hosts, I demonstrate that\nwell-localized long-duration GRBs are connected with otherwise normal\nstar-forming galaxies at moderate redshifts of order unity. I test various\nprogenitor scenarios by examining the offset distribution of GRBs about their\napparent hosts, making extensive use of ground-based optical data from Keck and\nPalomar and space-based imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope. The offset\ndistribution appears to be inconsistent with the coalescing neutron star binary\nhypothesis but statistically consistent with a population of progenitors that\nclosely traces the ultra-violet light of galaxies. This is naturally explained\nby bursts which originate from the collapse of massive stars. This claim is\nfurther supported by the unambiguous detections of emission ''bumps'' which can\nbe explained as supernovae that occur at approximately the same time as the\nassociated GRB; if true, GRB 980326 and GRB 011121 provide strong observational\nevidence connecting cosmological GRBs to high-redshift supernovae and implicate\nmassive stars as the progenitors of some long-duration GRBs. Interestingly,\nmost alternative models of these bumps require wind-stratified circumburst\nmedia; this too, implicates massive stars. In addition to this work, I also\nconstructed the Jacobs Camera (JCAM), a dual-beam optical camera for the\nPalomar 200-inch Telescope designed to follow-up rapid GRB localizations\n(abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jan 2003 19:54:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

It is\nshown that the transition to the PG state occurs at the temperature T* as\ndimensional crossover when charges motion changes from the three dimensional\n(3D) to two-dimensional (2D). Namely two-dimensionality at T*>T is responsible\nfor the crucial role of Jahn-Teller (JT) distortions which bound up with holes\nand form delocalized JT polarons and the localized three spin polarons in\ncopper-oxygen planes that removes the competition between pairing carriers and\ntheir localization. At the cooling T*>T the SC transition occurs at Tc as a\nsequence of the crossovers from zero-dimensional to 2D SC fluctuations, and\nthen to the 3D SC fluctuations. Some experimental evidence of the local hole-JT\npolaron pairs and dynamical dimension reduction in the PG and SC states are\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jan 2003 07:19:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Analytic results of peak mass shifts for the\ncases of both equal and unequal mass decay products are derived. The shift is\nexpressed in terms of the peak mass and width of the vacuum or medium-modified\nspectral functions and temperature. Examples of expected shifts in meson (e.g.,\nrho, omega, and sigma) and baryon (e.g., Delta) resonances that are helpful to\ninterpret recent RHIC measurements at BNL are provided. Although significant\ndownward mass shifts are caused by widened widths of the $\\rho-$meson in\nmedium, a downward shift of at least 50 MeV in its intrinsic mass is required\nto account for the reported downward shift of 60-70 MeV in the peak of the\nrho-invariant mass distribution. An observed downward shift from the vacuum\npeak value of the Delta distinctively signals a significant downward shift in\nits intrinsic peak mass, since unlike for the rho-meson, phase space functions\nproduce an upward shift for the Delta isobar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jan 2003 17:32:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Apr 2003 16:26:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
