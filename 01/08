Near infrared galaxy surveys have\nrevealed the existence of nuclear stellar bars in a large number of barred or\nlenticular galaxies. High resolution CO maps of these galaxies exhibit a wide\nrange of morphologies. Recent simulations of double-barred galaxies suggest\nthat variations in the gas properties may allow it to respond differently to\nsimilar gravitational potentials. We find that the 12CO J=3-2/J=2-1 line ratio\nis lower in galaxies with centrally concentrated gas distributions and higher\nin galaxies with CO emission dispersed around the galactic center in rings and\npeaks. The 13CO/12CO J=2-1 line ratios are similar for all galaxies, which\nindicates that the J=3-2/J=2-1 line ratio is tracing variations in gas\ntemperature and density, rather than variations in optical depth. There is\nevidence that the galaxies which contain more centralized CO distributions are\ncomprised of molecular gas that is cooler and less dense. Observations suggest\nthat the star formation rates are higher in the galaxies containing the warmer,\ndenser, less centrally concentrated gas.

Future study of the\nmicrowave background will mostly be directed towards two basic questions: a\ncomplete characterization of the initial perturbations, and probes of the\nnonlinear evolution of structure in the Universe. The basic scientific issues\nin both of these areas are reviewed here, along with possibilities for\naddressing them with further microwave background measurements at higher\nsensitivities and smaller angular scales. The proposed ACT experiment, which\nwill map 200 square degrees of sky at arcminute resolution and micro-Kelvin\nsensitivity in three microwave frequency bands, is briefly described as an\nexample of rapidly advancing experimental technique.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jan 2003 15:27:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Such notches occur in silicon that has been formed\nby etching into microelectromechanical structures and tend to be the initiation\nsites for failure by fracture of these structures. Analogous to the stress\nintensity factor of traditional linear elastic fracture mechanics which\ncharacterizes the stress state in the limiting case of a crack, there exists a\nsimilar parameter K for the case of the notch. In the case of silicon, a\nbrittle material, this characterization appears to be particularly valid.

We probe their\nassociated hybrid vibrational-electric field, in the THz range, by\nelectro-optic sampling methods. The measured field patterns agree very well\nwith calculations for the field due to a distribution of dipoles that follows\nthe shape and moves with the group velocity of the optical pulses. For a\ntightly focused pulse, the pattern is identical to that of classical Cherenkov\nradiation by a moving dipole. Results for other shapes and, in particular, for\nthe planar and transient-grating geometries, are accounted for by a convolution\nof the Cherenkov field due to a point dipole with the function describing the\nslowly-varying intensity of the pulse. Hence, polariton fields resulting from\npulses of arbitrary shape can be described quantitatively in terms of\nexpressions for the Cherenkov radiation emitted by an extended source. Using\nthe Cherenkov approach, we recover the phase-matching conditions that lead to\nthe selection of specific polariton wavevectors in the planar and transient\ngrating geometry as well as the Cherenkov angle itself.

The charged lepton mass\nspectrum emerges from the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism interpreted in terms of\ndeconstructed extra dimensions compactified on S^1. A normal neutrino mass\nhierarchy arises from the coupling to right-handed neutrinos propagating in\nlatticized S^1/Z_2 orbifold extra dimensions. Here, the solar mass squared\ndifference is suppressed by the size of the dynamically generated bulk\nmanifold. Without tuning of parameters, the model yields the solar mixing angle\ntheta_{12} = arctan 1/2^{1/2}.
