The outflow\nbegins at a blueshift of ~1650 km/s from the systemic redshift. The lowest\nvelocity BAL region produces strong CaII absorption but does not produce\nsignificant excited FeII absorption, while the higher velocity excited FeII\nabsorption region produces very little CaII absorption.

Whether the outflow is smooth\nor clumpy, we conclude that the CaII BAL region has a density high enough to\npopulate excited levels of FeII, but a temperature low enough to prevent them\nfrom being significantly populated. This requirement means the CaII BAL region\nhas T<1000 K, and perhaps even T<550 K.

The simulations start at redshift z=4.85 with a small dark\nhalo in a LCDM universe and we follow the evolution until the present epoch.\nThe energy release by massive stars and SNe prevents a rapid collapse of the\nbaryonic matter and delays the maximum star formation until z=1. The galaxy\nforms radially from inside-out and vertically from halo to disk.

Every discrete time step, we choose the vertex with\nminimal fitness, and assign to this vertex, and to its two neighbours, three\nnew independent fitnesses with a uniform distribution on $[0,1]$.

As\nour results demonstrate, for determining the pointer states, the\nChebyshev-based scheme is at least a factor of 8 faster than existing\nalgorithms based on the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition. For the problems of\nsecond type, the Chebyshev-based approach has been 3--4 times faster than the\nSuzuki-Trotter-based schemes. This conclusion holds qualitatively for a wide\nspectrum of systems, with different spin baths and different Hamiltonians.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2003 18:44:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
