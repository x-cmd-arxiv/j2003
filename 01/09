We compare their observed and absolute K magnitudes as well as their\nR-K colours with those of other distant sources detected in various optical,\nnear-infrared, mid-infrared and submillimeter deep surveys. We find that the\nGRB host galaxies, most of them lying at 0.5<z<1.5, exhibit very blue colours,\ncomparable to those of the faint blue star-forming sources at high redshift.\nThey are sub-luminous in the K-band, suggesting a low stellar mass content. We\ndo not find any GRB hosts harbouring R- and K-band properties similar to those\ncharacterizing the luminous infrared/submillimeter sources and the extremely\nred starbursts. Should GRBs be regarded as an unbiased probe of star-forming\nactivity, this lack of luminous and/or reddened objects among the GRB host\nsample might reveal that the detection of GRB optical afterglows is likely\nbiased toward unobscured galaxies. It would moreover support the idea that a\nlarge fraction of the optically-dark GRBs occur within dust-enshrouded regions\nof star formation. On the other hand, our result might also simply reflect\nintrinsic properties of GRB host galaxies experiencing a first episode of very\nmassive star formation and characterized by a rather weak underlying stellar\npopulation. Finally, we compute the absolute B magnitudes for the whole sample\nof GRB host galaxies with known redshifts and detected at optical wavelengths.\nWe find that the latter appear statistically even less luminous than the\nsub-luminous blue sources which mostly contributed to the B-band light emitted\nat high redshift. This indicates that the formation of GRBs could be favoured\nin particular systems with very low luminosities and, therefore, low\nmetallicities.

One of our goals is to explore\nthe self-consistency of this assumption by analyzing the causality of the\nviscous transport near the black hole. The effects of general relativity are\nincorporated in an approximate manner by utilizing a pseudo-Newtonian\ngravitational potential. Analysis of the conservation equations yields unique\nasymptotic forms for the behaviors of the radial inflow velocity, the density,\nthe sound speed, and the angular velocity.

A universal feature of these amorphous systems is the Boson peak: the\nvibrational density of states $g(\\omega)$ has an excess over the Debye (squared\nfrequency) law, seen as a peak in $g(\\omega)/\\omega^2$.

For dc-fields below the first matching field\n$H_1$, $\\alpha$ reaches its highest value associated with a Mott Insulator-like\nphase where vortex lines are strongly localized at the pinning sites. For\n$H_1<H_{dc}<H_2$, the response is mainly due to the interstitial vortices and\n$\\alpha$ drops to smaller values as expected for this metallic-like regime.\nStrikingly, for $H_2<H_{dc}<H_3$, we observe that $\\alpha$ reduces further\ndown. However, for $H_3<H_{dc}<H_4$, a reentrance in the pinning strength is\nobserved, due to a specific configuration of the flux line lattice which\nstrongly restricts the mobility of vortices.

The problem of\nsolving the system of BCS gap equations expressing the $^3P_2$-$^3F_2$ model is\nattacked with the aid of the separation approach. This method, developed\noriginally for quantitative study of S-wave pairing in the presence of strong\nshort-range repulsions, serves effectively to reduce the coupled, singular,\nnonlinear BCS integral equations to a set of coupled algebraic equations. For\nthe first time, sufficient precision becomes accessible to resolve small energy\nsplittings between the different pairing states.

The P-F channel coupling is seen to lift the striking\nparametric degeneracies revealed by a earlier separation treatment of the pure,\nuncoupled $^3P_2$ pairing problem.
