We employ the\nstandard definition of the SG as a pair-free space between the last open field\nlines and the boundary of the pair plasma column which is expected to develop\nabove the bulk of the PC. The rationale for our revision is that the proper\ntreatment of primary acceleration within the pulsar SGs should take into\naccount the effect of the narrow geometry of the gap on the electrodynamics\nwithin the gap and also to include the effect of inertial frame dragging on the\nparticle acceleration. The combination of the effects of frame dragging and\ngeometrical screening in the gap region naturally gives rise to a regime of\nextended acceleration, that is not limited to \"favorably curved\" field lines as\nin earlier models, and the possibility of multiple-pair production by curvature\nphotons at very high altitudes, up to several stellar radii. The estimated\ntheoretical high-energy luminosities of the SG cascade radiation are in good\nagreement with the corresponding empirical relationships for gamma-ray pulsars.\nWe illustrate the results of our modeling of the pair cascades and gamma-ray\nemission from the high altitudes in the SG for the Crab pulsar.

The M1 transitions in the charmonium system are shown to be sensitive\nto the relativistic aspect of the spin-flip magnetic moment operator, and the\nLorentz structure of the Q\\bar Q interaction. The observed rate for the M1\ntransition J/psi -> eta_c gamma is shown to provide strong evidence for a\nscalar confining interaction.\n  The single pion and dipion widths are calculated for the heavy-light D\nmesons, by employment of the pseudovector pion-quark coupling suggested by\nchiral perturbation theory. The pionic transitions D* -> D pi are shown to\nprovide constraining information on the pion-quark axial coupling g_A^q. It is\nalso shown that axial exchange charge contributions associated with the Q\\bar q\ninteraction suppress the axial charge amplitude for pion emission by an order\nof magnitude. The models for pi and M1 transitions also make it possible to\nestimate the eta-nucleon coupling from the transition Ds* -> D_s pi0, once the\nvalue of the pi^0 - eta mixing angle is known.\n  Finally, the dipion transition rates of the L=1 D mesons are calculated, and\nare shown to make up a significant fraction of their total widths for strong\ndecay. The pipi transitions between S-wave charmonium and bottomonium states\nare modeled in terms of a broad sigma meson with derivative couplings to pions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jan 2003 13:23:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

A prominent\ncharacteristic maximum is predicted only in the parameters for $3d_{5/2}$\nphotoionization, while the effect for $3d_{3/2}$ is rather weak. The results\nare obtained within the framework of the Generalized Random Phase Approximation\nwith Exchange (GRPAE), which in addition to the RPAE effects takes into account\nthe rearrangement of all atomic electrons due to the creation of a 3d vacancy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jan 2003 20:13:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
