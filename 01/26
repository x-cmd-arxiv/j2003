We find that the\npresence or absence of heavy elements in the hot DA white dwarfs largely\nreflects what would be expected if radiative levitation is the supporting\nmechanism, although the measured abundances do not match the predicted values\nvery well, as reported by other authors in the past. Almost all stars hotter\nthan ~50000K contain heavy elements. For most of these the spread in element\nabundances is quite narrow and similar to the abundances measured in G191-B2B.\nHowever, there is an unexplained dichotomy at lower temperatures with some\nstars having apparently pure H envelopes and others detectable quantities of\nheavy elements. The heavy elements present in these cooler stars are often\nstratified, lying in the outermost layers of the envelope.

It\nturns out that for this problem a smaller quantum computer can solve problems\nfurther beyond current computing than for integer factorisation. A 160 bit\nelliptic curve cryptographic key could be broken on a quantum computer using\naround 1000 qubits while factoring the security-wise equivalent 1024 bit RSA\nmodulus would require about 2000 qubits. In this paper we only consider\nelliptic curves over GF($p$) and not yet the equally important ones over\nGF($2^n$) or other finite fields. The main technical difficulty is to implement\nEuclid's gcd algorithm to compute multiplicative inverses modulo $p$. As the\nruntime of Euclid's algorithm depends on the input, one difficulty encountered\nis the ``quantum halting problem''.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jan 2003 21:28:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Jan 2004 16:33:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
