All fluid perturbations are singular\nat the so--called magnetic resonances, where the Doppler shifted frequency of\nthe perturbation matches that of a slow MHD wave propagating along the field\nline. These lie on both sides of the corotation radius. Waves propagate outside\nthe Lindblad resonances, and also in a restricted region around the magnetic\nresonances. The magnetic resonances contribute to a significant global torque\nwhich, like the Lindblad torque, is negative (positive) inside (outside) the\nplanet's orbit. Since these resonances are closer to the planet than the\nLindblad resonances, the torque they contribute dominates over the Lindblad\ntorque if the magnetic field is large enough. In addition, if beta=c^2/v_A^2\nincreases fast enough with radius, the outer magnetic resonance becomes less\nimportant and the total torque is then negative, dominated by the inner\nmagnetic resonance. This leads to outward migration of the planet. Even for\nbeta=100 at corotation, a negative torque may be obtained. A planet migrating\ninward through a nonmagnetized region of a disc would then stall when reaching\na magnetized region. It would then be able to grow to become a terrestrial\nplanet or the core of a giant planet. In a turbulent magnetized disc in which\nthe large scale field structure changes sufficiently slowly, a planet may\nalternate between inward and outward migration, depending on the gradients of\nthe field encountered. Its migration could then become diffusive, or be limited\nonly to small scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2003 17:07:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We show that\n$\\gamma$ can nevertheless be determined in an elegant and essentially\nunambiguous manner from the $B_{d,s}\\to D[\\to f_{NE}]f_s$ observables with the\nhelp of the corresponding ``untagged'' $B_{d,s}\\to D[\\to f_\\pm]f_s$\nmeasurements. Moreover, we may also extract hadronic B- and D-decay parameters.\nSeveral interesting features of decays of the kind $B_{d,s}\\to D f_d$ are also\npointed out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jan 2003 11:50:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Oct 2003 10:13:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-23"}
