It is used\nextensively in studies of the perturbed Kepler problem in celestial mechanics\nand atomic physics. In contrast to the conventional matrix-based approach, the\nformulation of the KS transformation in the language of geometric Clifford\nalgebra offers the advantages of a clearer geometrical interpretation and\ngreater computational simplicity. It is demonstrated that the geometric algebra\nformalism can readily be used to derive a Lagrangian and Hamiltonian\ndescription of the KS dynamics in arbitrary static electromagnetic fields. For\norbits starting at the Coulomb centre, initial conditions are derived and a\nframework is set up that allows a discussion of the stability of these orbits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jan 2003 16:24:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Here we describe the foraging patterns of free-ranging spider monkeys\n(Ateles geoffroyi) in the forest of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico and find that\nthese patterns resemble what physicists know as Levy walks. First, the length\nof a trajectory s constituent steps, or continuous moves in the same direction,\nis best described by a power-law distribution in which the frequency of ever\nlarger steps decreases as a negative power function of their length. The rate\nof this decrease is very close to that predicted by a previous analytical Levy\nwalk model to be an optimal strategy to search for scarce resources distributed\nat random Viswanathan et al 1999). Second, the frequency distribution of the\nduration of stops or waiting times also approximates a power-law function.\nFinally, the mean square displacement during the monkeys first foraging trip\nincreases more rapidly than would be expected from a random walk with constant\nstep length, but within the range predicted for Levy walks. In view of these\nresults, we analyze the different exponents characterizing the trajectories\ndescribed by females and males, and by monkeys on their own or when part of a\nsubgroup. We discuss the origin of these patterns and their implications for\nthe foraging ecology of spider monkeys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jan 2003 23:58:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Our description\nis based on the standard interpretation of the quantum theory for measurement,\nand accords with the experimental result in the squeezed state generation\nscheme. We apply our description of BHD to continuous-variable quantum\nteleportation (CVQT) with a conventional laser to analyze the CVQT experiment\n[A. Furusawa et al., Science 282, 706 (1998)], whose validity has been\nquestioned on the ground of intrinsic phase indeterminacy of the laser field\n[T. Rudolph and B.C. Sanders, Phys. Rev.

The CVQT\nexperiment is considered valid with the aid of an optical path other than the\nEPR channel and a classical channel, directly linking between a sender and a\nreceiver. We also propose a method to probabilistically generate a strongly\nphase-correlated quantum state via continuous measurement of independent\nlasers, which is applicable to realizing CVQT without the additional optical\npath.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jan 2003 08:30:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
