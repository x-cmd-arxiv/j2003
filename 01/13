Remarkably, the coarse pulse shape is stable\nfrom the optical up to X-ray energies analogous to the case of the Crab pulsar\n(PSR B0531+21). The profiles can be described with two Gaussians with a phase\nseparation of ~0.2; the distribution of the ratios between the two components\nfrom the optical to the X-ray range is consistent with being flat. Therefore we\ncannot conclude that the profile consists of two distinct components.

The homogeneity constraint is therefore necessary\nfor finite systems in order to align to the ``meaning'' of infinite systems\nphase diagrams. In this respect, a method which deduces the equation of state\nof homogeneous finite systems from the one corresponding to bulk matter is\ndesigned. The resultant phase diagrams show a strong dependence on the system's\nsize.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2003 13:24:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

It is therefore\ninadvisable to use lower order results to simplify the current approximation as\nis done in the traditional Chapman-Enskog procedure, since that is an iterative\nmethod. By avoiding such recycling of lower order results, one obtains\nmacroscopic equations that are asymptotically equivalent to the ones found in\nthe Chapman-Enskog approach. The new equations contain higher order terms that\nare discarded in the Chapman-Enskog method. These make a significant impact on\nthe results for such problems as ultrasound propagation.
