The high-velocity triplet\nabsorption is highly polarized, with a different polarization angle than the\nrest of the spectrum. The unique observation allows us to construct a\nrelatively detailed picture of the layered geometrical structure of the\nsupernova ejecta: in our interpretation, the ejecta layers near the photosphere\n(v \\approx 10,000 km/s) obey a near axial symmetry, while a detached,\nhigh-velocity structure (v \\approx 18,000-25,000 km/s) with high CaII line\nopacity deviates from the photospheric axisymmetry. By partially obscuring the\nunderlying photosphere, the high-velocity structure causes a more incomplete\ncancellation of the polarization of the photospheric light, and so gives rise\nto the polarization peak and rotated polarization angle of the high-velocity IR\ntriplet feature. In an effort to constrain the ejecta geometry, we develop a\ntechnique for calculating 3-D synthetic polarization spectra and use it to\ngenerate polarization profiles for several parameterized configurations. In\nparticular, we examine the case where the inner ejecta layers are ellipsoidal\nand the outer, high-velocity structure is one of four possibilities: a\nspherical shell, an ellipsoidal shell, a clumped shell, or a toroid. The\nsynthetic spectra rule out the spherical shell model, disfavor a toroid, and\nfind a best fit with the clumped shell.
