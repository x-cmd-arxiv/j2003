A {\\it lossy} compressible cascade can generate density\nfluctuations and further turbulence at small scales from large-scale motions,\nimplying that the turbulence in MCs may originate from the compressions that\nform them. Below a {\\it sonic} scale $\\ls$, turbulence cannot induce any\nfurther subfragmentation, nor be a dominant support agent against gravity.\nSince progressively smaller density peaks contain progressively smaller\nfractions of the mass, we expect the SFE to decrease with decreasing $\\ls$, at\nleast when the cloud is globally supported by turbulence. Our numerical\nexperiments confirm this prediction. We also find that the collapsed mass\nfraction in the simulations always saturates below 100% efficiency. This may be\ndue to the decreased mean density of the leftover interclump medium, which in\nreal clouds (not confined to a box) should then be more easily dispersed,\nmarking the ``death'' of the cloud. We identify two different functional\ndependences (``modes'') of the SFE on $\\ls$, which roughly correspond to\nglobally supported and unsupported cases. Globally supported runs with most of\nthe turbulent energy at the largest scales have similar SFEs to those of\nunsupported runs, providing numerical evidence of the dual role of turbulence,\nwhereby large-scale turbulent modes induce collapse at smaller scales. We\ntentatively suggest that these modes may correspond to the clustered and\nisolated modes of star formation, although here they are seen to form part of a\ncontinuum rather than being separate modes.

The study of the frequency\ndistribution of drawdowns, or runs of successive losses shows that large\nfinancial crashes are ``outliers'': they form a class of their own as can be\nseen from their statistical signatures. If large financial crashes are\n``outliers'', they are special and thus require a special explanation, a\nspecific model, a theory of their own. In addition, their special properties\nmay perhaps be used for their prediction. The main mechanisms leading to\npositive feedbacks, i.e., self-reinforcement, such as imitative behavior and\nherding between investors are reviewed with many references provided to the\nrelevant literature outside the confine of Physics. Positive feedbacks provide\nthe fuel for the development of speculative bubbles, preparing the instability\nfor a major crash.

The production\nrate for such black holes has been extensively studied for the case of a\nproton-proton collision at \\sqrt s = 14 TeV and for a lead-lead collision at\n\\sqrt s = 5.5 TeV at LHC. As the parton energy density is much higher at\nlead-lead collisions than in pp collisions at LHC, one natural question is\nwhether the produced black holes will be able to absorb the partons formed in\nthe lead-lead collisions and eventually `eat' the quark-gluon plasma formed at\nLHC.

Hence, we argue that black holes\nformed in such collisions will decay very quickly, and will not absorb very\nmany nearby partons. More precisely, we show that for the black hole mass to\nincrease via parton absorption at the LHC the typical energy density of quarks\nand gluons should be of the order of 10^{10} GeV/fm^3. As LHC will not be able\nto produce such a high energy density partonic system, the black hole will not\nbe able to absorb a sufficient number of nearby partons before it decays.

In the present work, it is argued --by taking into account of the views\nof learned scientists and philosophers-- that modern science is incomplete and\nlacking something in the basic understanding of nature \\cite{r}. Classical\nphysics has failed to explain the dynamics of the microscopic particles,\neventhough modern scientific researches are based upon the prejudice posed by\nclassical physics: keeping the outer physical universe as a separate entity,\nthat is something quite independent of the observer --human mind. One should\nnot forget that human-being is a part of nature and human mind is an essential\ncomponent of our observations. Basically, it is the observer --the\nconsciousness-- which makes perception possible. The working of human mind must\nbe included in our scientific theories.

One or\nmore trusted servers distribute streams of entangled photons to individual\nresources that seek to communicate. It is assumed that each resource shares a\npreviously distributed secret key with the trusted server, and that resources\ncan communicate with the server using both classical and quantum channels.\nResources do not share secret keys with each other, so that the key\ndistribution problem for the network is reduced from O(n^2) to O(n). Some\nadvantages of the protocol are that it avoids the requirement for timestamps\nused in classical protocols, guarantees that the trusted server cannot know the\nauthentication key, can provide resistance to multiple photon splitting attacks\nand can be used with BB84 or other quantum key distribution protocols.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2003 17:01:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
