The occupation of the 1:1 and 5:2 MMRs\nis not easily understood within the standard model of resonance sweeping by a\nmigratory Neptune over an initially dynamically cold belt.

The hot orbits\nof such 5:2 resonant KBOs, unlike hot orbits of previously known resonant KBOs,\nmay imply that these objects were pre-heated to large inclination and large\neccentricity prior to resonance capture by a migratory Neptune.

From consideration of the observed\nabundances in metal-poor stars, it is proposed that the production of the heavy\nr-process nuclei (with mass numbers A>130) is not related to the production of\nthe Fe group elements or of the elements with lower atomic numbers: Na, Mg, Al,\nSi, Ca, Sc, and Ti. This requires that the production of the heavy r-nuclei not\noccur in supernovae with extended shell structure, but be associated with\neither bare neutron stars or SNe II in the range of 8-10 solar masses. From the\nobservations of stars with [Fe/H]=-3 but with high abundances of r-elements, it\nis clear that these r-process enrichments cannot represent the composition of\nthe interstellar medium from which the stars were formed, but must represent\nvery local contamination from binary companions. Further evidence for very high\nenrichments of s-process elements in metal-poor stars also requires binary\nsystems for explanation.

The case considered is a grain\nboundary separating lamellae along the so called parallel orientation (with\nwavevector parallel to the velocity gradient direction) and along the\ntransverse orientation (wavevector parallel to the shear direction). In the\nmodel considered lamellae in the parallel orientation are marginal with respect\nto the shear, whereas transverse lamellae are uniformly compressed instead. A\nmultiple scale expansion valid in the weak segregation regime and for low shear\nfrequencies leads to an envelope equation for the grain boundary. This equation\nshows that the grain boundary moves by the action of the shear, with a velocity\nthat has two contributions. The first contribution, which arises from the\nchange in orientation of the grain boundary as it is being sheared, describes\nvariations in monomer density in the boundary region. This contribution is\nperiodic in time with twice the frequency of the shear and, by itself, leads to\nno net motion of the boundary. The second contribution arises from a free\nenergy increase within the bulk transverse lamellae under shear. It is also\nperiodic with twice the frequency of the shear, but it does not average to\nzero, leading to a net reduction in the extent of the region occupied by the\ntransverse lamellae. We find in the limit studied that the velocity of the\ngrain boundary can be expressed as the product of a mobility coefficient times\na driving force, the latter given by the excess energy stored in the transverse\nphase being sheared.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2003 14:25:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It provides a lower bound on the\ndissipated energy when timing information of microscopic systems is converted\nto classical information. This is relevant for low power computation since it\nshows the amount of heat generated whenever a band limited signal controls a\nclassical bit switch.\n  Our result provides a general bound on the information-disturbance trade-off\nfor von-Neumann measurements that distinguish states on the orbits of\ncontinuous unitary one-parameter groups with bounded spectrum. In contrast,\ninformation gain without disturbance is possible for some completely positive\nsemi-groups.

The\natom and radiation subsystems exhibit alternating sets of collapses and\nrevivals in a complementary fashion due to the initially mixed states of the\natom and radiation employed here.

The magnitudes of the entanglement lower bound and the atomic and\nradiation revivals become larger as both magnitude and phase of the Bell-like\ninitial state contribution increases.
