Here we test these suggestions by fitting the\ndetailed mid-ultraviolet (2280-3120A) and optical (3850-4750A) spectra of one\nmoderately metal-rich M31 globular cluster, G1. We explore the effects of a\nwide range of non-solar temperatures and abundance ratios, by combining a small\nset of theoretical stellar spectra like those of Peterson et al. (2001) that\nwere calculated using extensively updated atomic-line constants. To match the\nmid-UV fluxes of G1, we find that hot components with Teff >= 8000K must be\nincluded. We obtain a very good fit with cool and hot blue horizontal branch\n(BHB) stars, but less satisfactory fits for blue straggler stars, those hotter\nthan the main-sequence turnoff.\n  The G1 color-magnitude diagram does show cool BHB stars, and the color of its\ngiant branch supports the metallicity of one-sixth the solar value that we\ndeduce. The turnoff temperature of the best-fit model is consistent with that\nof turnoff stars in galactic globular clusters and the field halo, indicating\nG1 is comparably old. Because metal-rich cool BHB and extremely blue HB stars\nhave now been found within our own Galaxy, we suggest that these hot\nhorizontal-branch stars be considered in fitting spectra of metal-rich\npopulations such as the Andromeda globular clusters, to avoid possible\nunderestimates of their ages.

If this\nscenario is correct, one way to test the disk hypothesis is to search for\noutflows perpendicular to the methanol maser distributions. The main objective\nof the survey was to obtain wide-field near-infrared images of the sites of\nlinearly distributed methanol masers using a narrow-band 2.12 micron filter.\nThis filter is centered on the H2 v=1-0 S(1) line; a shock diagnostic that has\nbeen shown to successfully trace CO outflows from young stellar objects.\nTwenty-eight sources in total were imaged of which eighteen sources display H2\nemission. Of these, only TWO sources showed emission found to be dominantly\nperpendicular to the methanol maser distribution. Surprisingly, the H2 emission\nin these fields is not distributed randomly, but instead the majority of\nsources are found to have H2 emission dominantly PARALLEL to their distribution\nof methanol masers. These results seriously question the hypothesis that\nmethanol masers exist in circumstellar disks. The possibility that linearly\ndistributed methanol masers are instead directly associated with outflows is\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2003 15:05:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

It is shown that impurity ionization is due to\nphonon-assisted tunneling which proceeds at high electric field strengths into\ndirect tunneling without involving phonons. In the quasi-static regime of low\nfrequencies the tunneling probability is independent on frequency. Carrier\nemission is accomplished by defect tunneling in configuration space and\nelectron tunneling through the potential well formed by the attractive force of\nthe impurity and the externally applied electric field. The dependence of the\nionization probability on the electric field strength permits to determine\ndefect tunneling times, the structure of the adiabatic potentials of the\ndefect, and the Huang-Rhys parameters of electron-phonon interaction. Raising\nthe frequency leads to an enhancement of tunneling ionization and the tunneling\nprobability gets frequency dependent. The transition from the frequency\nindependent quasi-static limit to frequency dependent tunneling is determined\nby the tunneling time which is in the case of phonon asissted tunneling\ncontrolled by the temperature. This transition to the high-frequency limit\nrepresents the boundary between semiclassical physics, where the radiation\nfield has a classical amplitude, and full quantum mechanics where the radiation\nfield is quantized and impurity ionization is caused by multi-photon processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2003 10:06:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The quantum free oscillators are the quantum analogue of\nclassical action angle variable solutions for the coupled oscillators and\nquantum resonances, including Breit-Wigner resonances.

It is known that Einstein\nhomogeneous spaces G/H generate Ricci flat manifolds with special holonomies on\ntheir cones R_+ x G/H, when they are endowed with appropriate geometrical\nstructures, namely, the Sasaki-Einstein, tri-Sasakian, nearly Kahler, and weak\nG_2 structures for SU(n), Sp(n), G_2, and Spin(7) holonomies, respectively.\nMotivated by this fact, we consider the string vacua of the type: R^{d-1,1} x\n(N = 1 Liouville) x (N=1 supercoset CFT on G/H) where we use the affine Lie\nalgebras of G and H in order to capture the geometry associated to an Einstein\nhomogeneous space G/H. Remarkably, we find the same number of spacetime and\nworldsheet SUSY's in our ``CFT cone'' construction as expected from the\nanalysis of geometrical cones over G/H in many examples. We also present an\nanalysis on the possible Liouville potential terms (cosmological constant type\noperators) which provide the marginal deformations resolving the conical\nsingularities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2003 05:03:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 2003 07:34:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-05"}
