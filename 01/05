Such\noverall calibration biases cannot be detected by the standard tests such as E/B\ndecomposition or calibration with stars. We find that the non-Gaussianity of\npoint spread function has a significant effect and can lead to up to 15 per\ncent error on the linear amplitude of fluctuations sigma_8 depending on the\nmethod of analysis. This could explain some of the discrepancies seen in recent\namplitude determinations from weak lensing. Using an elliptical Laguerre\nexpansion method we develop a re-Gaussianization method which reduces the error\nto calibration error of order 1 per cent even for poorly resolved galaxies. We\nalso discuss a new type of shear selection bias which results in up to roughly\n8 percent underestimation of the signal. It is expected to scale with redshift,\ninducing errors in the growth factor extraction if not properly corrected for.\nUnderstanding and correcting for such effects is crucial if weak lensing is to\nbecome a high precision probe of cosmology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jan 2003 17:37:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Apr 2003 19:14:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The approach\nallowed us to obtain the functional of the Ginzburg-Landau-Wilson (GLW)\nHamiltonian expressed in terms of the CV (fluctuating densities). The\ncorresponding set of CV included the variable connected with the order\nparameter. In this paper we use this approach to the study of the critical\nbehaviour of ionic fluids. For the restricted primitive model (RPM) we obtain\nthe functional of the grand partition function in the phase space of the two\nfluctuating fields conjugate to the fluctuating densities.

In very heavy\nsystems, where the level density is high, this level of accuracy is not\nsufficient for reliable predictions of the location of relatively small\ndeformed shell gaps. The calculated moments of inertia reveal only small\nsensitivity to the RMF parametrization and, thus, to differences in the\nsingle-particle structure.
