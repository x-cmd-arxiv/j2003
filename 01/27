It is then\nshown, using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and also a Poisson resummation\ntechnique, that {\\it perfect} coherence of the atom can in general never be\nachieved. The atom and the radiation field are, however, to a good\napproximation in a pure state $|\\psi >_A\\otimes|\\psi >_R$ in the middle of what\nhas been traditionally called the ``collapse region'', independent of the\ninitial state of the atoms, provided that the initial pure state of the\nradiation field has a photon number probability distribution which is\nsufficiently peaked and phase differences that do not vary significantly around\nthis peak. An approximative analytic expression for the quantity\n$\\Tr[\\rho^2_{A}(t)]$, where $\\rho_{A}(t)$ is the reduced density matrix for the\natom, is derived.
