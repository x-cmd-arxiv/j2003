The ingested plasma convects embedded,\nfrozen-in toroidal magnetic flux from z=+h,-h to z=0. The counter-directed\nflows collide and stagnate at z=0 and in so doing (i) convert their\ntranslational kinetic energy into heat, (ii) increase the plasma density at\nz~0, and (iii) increase the embedded toroidal flux density at z~0. The increase\nin toroidal flux density at z~0 increases the toroidal field Bphi and hence\nincreases the magnetic pinch force at z~0 and so causes a reduction of the flux\ntube radius at z~0. Thus, the flux tube develops an axially uniform\ncross-section, a decreased volume, an increased density, and an increased\ntemperature.
