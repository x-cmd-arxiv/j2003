Most of\nthe above trends can be explained in terms of the properties of the large-scale\noutflows seen in LBGs. According to this scenario, the appearance of LBG\nspectra is determined by a combination of the covering fraction of outflowing\nneutral gas which contains dust, and the range of velocities over which this\ngas is absorbing.

Specifically, we deduce the gas\ndensity distribution from measured X-ray brightness profiles, and substitute it\nin the hydrostatic equilibrium equation in order to derive the form of dark\nmatter profiles. Given some basic theoretical requirements from a dark matter\nprofile, we then consider a number of simple profiles that have the desired\nasymptotic form. We conclude that a dark matter density profile of the form\n1/(1+r/r_a)^3 is most consistent with current observational results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2003 09:29:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

Adiabatic growth of black holes generates power-law central density\nprofiles with logarithmic slopes in the range from ~1.5 to ~2.5, in good\nagreement with the profiles observed in the nuclei of galaxies fainter than\nvisual magnitude -20. However the shallow nuclear profiles of bright galaxies\nrequire a different explanation. Binary black holes are an inevitable result of\ngalactic mergers, and the ejection of stars by a massive binary displaces a\nmass of order the binary's own mass, creating a core or shallow power-law cusp.\nThis model is at least crudely consistent with core sizes in bright galaxies.\nUncertainties remain about the effectiveness of stellar- and gas-dynamical\nprocesses at inducing coalescence of binary black holes, and uncoalesced\nbinaries may be common in low-density nuclei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2003 15:38:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

For dilute solutions, the mechanism is\naccelerated zipping: zipping propagates outwards from the first attachment,\naccelerated by occasional formation of large loops which nucleate further\nzipping. This leads to a transient distribution omega(s) \\sim s^{-7/5} of loop\nlengths s up to a size s_max \\approx (Q t)^{5/3} after time t. By tau_ads the\nentire chain is adsorbed.

Here an exact general solution is obtained in\nthe form of an expression for the Wigner function at time t in terms of the\ninitial Wigner function. The result is applied to the motion of a Gaussian wave\npacket and to that of a pair of such wave packets. A serious divergence arising\nfrom the assumption of an initially uncoupled state is found to be due to the\nzero-point oscillations of the bath and not removed in a cutoff model. As a\nconsequence, worthwhile results for the equation can only be obtained in the\nhigh temperature limit, where zero-point oscillations are neglected. In that\nlimit closed form expressions for wave packet spreading and attenuation of\ncoherence are obtained.
