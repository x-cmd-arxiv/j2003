The coorbital torque is assumed to come from orbit crossing fluid\nelements which exchange angular momentum with the planet when they execute a\nU-turn at the end of horseshoe streamlines. When the planet migrates inward,\nthe fluid elements of the inner disk undergo one such exchange as they pass to\nthe outer disk. The angular momentum they gain is removed from the planet, and\nthis corresponds to a negative contribution to the corotation torque, which\nscales with the drift rate. In addition, the material trapped in the coorbital\nregion drifts radially with the planet giving a positive contribution to the\ncorotation torque, which also scales with the drift rate. These two\ncontributions do not cancel out if the coorbital region is depleted, in which\ncase there is a net corotation torque which scales with the drift rate and the\nmass deficit in the coorbital region, and which has same sign as the drift\nrate. This leads to a positive feedback on the migrating planet. In particular,\nif the coorbital mass deficit is larger than the planet mass, the migration\nrate undergoes a runaway which can vary the protoplanet semi-major axis by 50%\nover a few tens of orbits. This can happen only if the planet mass is\nsufficient to create a dip or gap in its surrounding region, and if the\nsurrounding disk mass is larger than the planet mass. This typically\ncorresponds to planet masses in the sub-Saturnian to Jovian mass range embedded\nin massive protoplanetary disks.

Over the 0.2-10 keV\nenergy range the power spectral density (PSD) is well-represented by a\npower-law with a slope of alpha_low ~ 1 at low frequencies, breaking to a slope\nof alpha_hi = 2.8 (-0.4/+0.2) at a frequency f_br ~ 5 x 10^-4 Hz. As has been\nnoted before this broken power-law PSD shape is similar to that observed in the\nGalactic black hole candidate Cygnus X-1. If it is assumed that Mrk 766 shows a\npower spectrum similar in form to that of Cyg X-1, and that the break timescale\nscales linearly with black hole mass, then the mass of the black hole in Mrk\n766 is inferred to be < 5 x 10^5 M_sun. This rather low mass would mean Mrk 766\nradiates above the Eddington limit. The coherence between different energy\nbands is significantly below unity implying that variations in the different\nenergy bands are rather poorly correlated. The low coherence can be explained\nin the framework of standard Comptonisation models if the properties of the\nComptonising medium are rapidly variable or if there are several distinct\nemission sites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jan 2003 15:48:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-17"}

However, this has been clarified by recent high-energy\nx-ray studies which have shown that PZN is rhombohedral only in the skin while\nthe shape of the unit cell in the bulk is nearly cubic. In this study we have\nperformed both neutron elastic and inelastic scattering to show that the\ntemperature dependence of both the diffuse and phonon scattering in PZN and PMN\nis very similar. Both compounds show a nearly identical recovery of the soft\noptic mode and a broadening of the acoustic mode below $T_{c}$.

In contrast to PMN, we observe a broadening\nof the Bragg peaks in both the longitudinal and transverse directions below\n$T_{c}$. We reconcile this additional broadening, not observed in PMN, in terms\nof structural inhomogeneity in PZN.

We employ realistic nucleon-nucleon forces and operate\nwithin the Dirac-Brueckner-Hartree-Fock approach to nuclear matter. The focal\npoint of this paper is a (momentum-space) G-matrix which properly accounts for\nthe asymmetry between protons and neutrons. This will merge naturally into the\ndevelopment of an effective interaction suitable for applications to asymmetric\nnuclei, which will be the object of extensive study in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2003 18:46:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Feb 2003 00:16:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-18"}
