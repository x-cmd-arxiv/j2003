If tiling is preferred, what cadence maximizes the\ndiscovery rate? As sky monitoring is a growing part of astronomical observing,\nutilized to find such phenomena as supernovae, microlensing, and planet\ntransits, well thought out answers to these questions are increasingly\nimportant. Answers are sky, source, and telescope dependent and should include\ninformation about the source luminosity distribution near the observation\nlimit, the duration of variability, the nature of the dominant noise, and the\nmagnitude of down and slew times. Usually, a critical slope of the effective\ncumulative transient apparent luminosity distribution (Log N - Log S) at the\nlimiting magnitude will define when \"tile\" or \"stare\" is superior. For\nshallower slopes, when \"tile\" is superior, optimal cadences and pointing\nalgorithms are discussed. For transients discovered on a single exposure or\ntime-contiguous series of exposures, when down and slew times are small and the\ncharacter of the noise is unchanged, the most productive cadence for isotropic\npower-law luminosity distributions is the duration of the transient -- faster\ncadences waste time re-discovering known transients, while slower cadences\nneglect transients occurring in other fields.

We study a theoretical\nmodel for the sequence evolution of binding sites by point mutations. The\napproach is based on biophysical models for the binding of transcription\nfactors to DNA. Hence we derive empirically grounded fitness landscapes, which\nenter a population genetics model including mutations, genetic drift, and\nselection.

For realistic values of the\nmodel parameters we obtain a phase characterized by enhanced spin density and\ncomposite charge density wave correlations, coexisting with subleading triplet\nand composite singlet pairing correlations. This result is shown to be\nindependent of the spatial orientation of the stripe on the square lattice.\nSlow transverse fluctuations of the stripes tend to suppress the density\ncorrelations, thus promoting the pairing instabilities. The largest amplitudes\nfor the composite instabilities appear when the stripe forms an antiphase\ndomain wall in the antiferromagnet. For twisted spin alignments the amplitudes\ndecrease and leave room for a new type of composite pairing correlation,\nbreaking parity but preserving time reversal symmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 2003 10:03:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The\ntwo photons were entangled at a beam splitter using the post-selection\ntechnique of Shih and Alley [Phys. Rev. Lett. 61, 2921 (1988)]. A quantum\ninterference pattern with a visibility of 91% was obtained using the photons\nfrom these independent sources, as compared with a visibility of 99.4% using\ntwo photons from a central parametric down-conversion source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 2003 15:16:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 May 2003 13:29:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
