Since the slope of our LMC Cepheid sample\nis clearly better defined than the one of the much smaller Galactic sample, we\nfit the LMC slopes to our Galactic calibrating Cepheid sample (which introduces\nonly a small uncertainty) to obtain our final, adopted and improved absolute\ncalibrations of the Cepheid PL relations in the VIWJHK bands. Comparing the\nabsolute magnitudes of 10-day period Cepheids in both galaxies which are only\nslightly affected by the different Galactic and LMC slopes of the PL relation,\nwe derive values for the LMC distance modulus in all these bands which can be\nmade to agree extremely well under reasonable assumptions for both, the\nreddening law, and the adopted reddenings of the LMC Cepheids. This yields, as\nour current best estimate from Cepheid variables, a LMC distance modulus of\n18.55 +- 0.06.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jan 2003 13:39:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

Our emphasis here is on disentangling\nordering from the intrinsic strongly correlated physics of a doped half-filled\nband. To this end, we focus on the 2D Hubbard model. Because the charge gap\narises from on-site correlations, we implement a non-perturbative approach\nwhich incorporates local physics. Crucial to this method is a self-consistent\ntwo-site dynamical cluster expansion which builds in the nearest-neighbour\nenergy scale, $J$.\n  At half-filling, we find that the spectral function possesses a gap of order\n$U$ and is devoid of any coherent quasi-particle peaks. In the doped case, we\nfind that the Fermi surface exceeds the Luttinger volume. Additionally in the\nunderdoped regime, we find that a pseudogap opens in the single particle\ndensity of states.The pseudogap closes above optimal doping and hence our\nproposal is not inconsistent with that of Loram. In analogy with the Mott gap\nand antiferromagnetism, we propose that ordering may also accompany the\nformation of a pseudogap. We suggest a current pattern within a 1-band model\nthat preserves translational but breaks time-reversal symmetry along the\ncanonical x and y axes but not along $x=\\pm y$ that is consistent with the\nexperimental observations.

The main ingredients in our analysis are the identification of a\nspecial Green's function, which serves as a common kernel to all self-energy\nand vertex diagrams, and the judicious use of the Slavnov-Taylor identity it\nsatisfies. In particular, it is shown that the ghost-Green's functions\nappearing in this identity capture precisely the result of the pinching action\nat arbitrary order. By virtue of this observation the construction of the\nquark-gluon vertex becomes particularly compact. It turns out that the\naforementioned ghost-Green's functions play a crucial role, their net effect\nbeing the non-trivial modification of the ghost diagrams of the quark-gluon\nvertex in such a way as to reproduce dynamically the characteristic ghost\nsector of the background field method.

First, an indirect derivation\nis given, by resorting to the strong induction method and the assumption of the\nuniqueness of the S-matrix. Second, an explicit construction based on the\nintrinsic pinch technique is provided, using the Slavnov-Taylor identity\nsatisfied by the all-order three-gluon vertex nested inside the self-energy\ndiagrams.

A common and powerful\napproach is to construct a trigonometric least squares approximation based on\nthe set of exponentials $\\{e^{2\\pi i kx}\\}$. This leads to fast numerical\nalgorithms, but suffers from disturbing boundary effects due to the underlying\nperiodicity assumption on the data, an assumption that is rarely satisfied in\npractice. To overcome this drawback we impose Neumann boundary conditions on\nthe data. This implies the use of cosine polynomials $\\cos (\\pi kx)$ as basis\nfunctions. We show that scattered data approximation using cosine polynomials\nleads to a least squares problem involving certain Toeplitz+Hankel matrices. We\nderive estimates on the condition number of these matrices. Unlike other\nToeplitz+Hankel matrices, the Toeplitz+Hankel matrices arising in our context\ncannot be diagonalized by the discrete cosine transform, but they still allow a\nfast matrix-vector multiplication via DCT which gives rise to fast conjugate\ngradient type algorithms.

The numerical\nsolutions for the gluon and ghost propagators obtained from a truncated set of\nDyson--Schwinger equations provide an explicit example for the anticipated\ninfrared behaviour. The results are in good agreement, also quantitatively,\nwith corresponding lattice data obtained recently. The resulting running\ncoupling approaches a fixed point in the infrared, $\\alpha(0) = 8.915/N_c$.\nSolutions for the coupled system of Dyson--Schwinger equations for the quark,\ngluon and ghost propagators are presented. Dynamical generation of quark masses\nand thus spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry takes place. In the quenched\napproximation the quark propagator functions agree well with those of\ncorresponding lattice calculations. For a small number of light flavours the\nquark, gluon and ghost propagators deviate only slightly from the ones in\nquenched approximation. While the positivity violation of the gluon spectral\nfunction is manifest in the gluon propagator, there are no clear indications of\nanalogous positivity violations for quarks so far.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jan 2003 14:58:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Using these original values of\nenergies the harmonic behavior of a number of base patterns of DNA has been\nstudied. In view of the great interest aroused by the discovery of the role of\nthe telomere segment of the DNA in the replication process and its possible\nlink with the aging process, we have investigated, with simple models, the\nharmonic behavior of the telomeric pattern of bases as well as the\nthermodynamic response in the biological system. With these results a\nconclusion on the probable role of the telomeric pattern on aging has also been\ndrawn. Here the calculated values of harmonic frequencies of the telomeric\npattern of bases and of other possible patterns show that the telomeric pattern\nis associated with the highest vibrational frequency among all patterns of base\ncombinations at the replication end of DNA. This seems to suggest that due to\nthe existing telomeric pattern being closest to the frequencies of the\nelectromagnetic radiation coming from sunlight, resonance of the telomeric\nfrequency with such radiation may be responsible for damage to the reproductive\nability of the cells and consequent aging and other problems. On the other hand\nin the last part of this work we have calculated the thermal vibrational\namplitudes of the telomeric pattern and other possible patterns which show that\nthe amplitude for the telomeric pattern is the least, and this suggests that\nthe telomeric pattern is more mechanically and thermally stable than other\npossible patterns in the biological environment against damage from ordinary\nheat and mechanical effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jan 2003 14:21:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
