One difference between the pseudo-hydro and full\nhydro simulations is in treating the dynamical relation between the IGM (or HI)\nand dark matter fields. The former assumes that the IGM density distribution\ntraces the underlying dark matter point-by-point on scales larger than the\nJeans length in either the linear or nonlinear regimes. However, hydrodynamic\nstudies have found that a statistical discrepancy between the IGM field and\nunderlying dark matter in nonlinear regime is possible.
