Thus the fraction of PopIII objects formed\nas a function of redshift is heavily dependent on the distribution of metals\nand fairly independent of the precise value of Z_cr. Using an analytical model\nof inhomogenous structure formation, we study the evolution of PopIII objects\nas a function of the star formation efficiency, IMF, and efficiency of outflow\ngeneration. For all models, PopIII objects tend to be in the 10^6.5-10^7.0\nsolar mass range, just large enough to cool within a Hubble time, but small\nenough that they are not clustered near areas of previous star formation.\nAlthough the mean metallicity exceeds Z_cr at a redshift of 15 in all models,\nthe peak of PopIII star formation occurs at z \\sim 10, and such stars continue\nto form well into the observable range. We discuss the observational properties\nof these objects, some of which may have already been detected in ongoing\nsurveys of high-redshift Lyman-alpha emitters. Finally, we combine our PopIII\ndistributions with the yield models of Heger and Woosley (2002) to study their\nimpact on the intracluster medium (ICM) in galaxy clusters. We find that PopIII\nstars can contribute no more than 20% of the iron observed in the ICM, although\ntheir peculiar elemental yields help to reconcile theoretical models with the\nobserved Fe and Si/Fe abundances.

We\nexplore the hierarchical growth of bound structures forming at redshifts z = 25\n- 30 with total masses in the range 10^5 - 10^6 Msun. The complex interplay\nbetween the gravitational formation of dark halos and the thermodynamic and\nchemical evolution of the gas clouds compromises analytic estimates of the\ncritical H2 fraction. Dynamical heating from mass accretion and mergers opposes\nrelatively inefficient cooling by molecular hydrogen, delaying the production\nof star-forming clouds in rapidly growing halos. We also investigate the impact\nof photo-dissociating ultra-violet (UV) radiation on the formation of\nprimordial gas clouds. We consider two extreme cases by first including a\nuniform radiation field in the optically thin limit and secondly by accounting\nfor the maximum effect of gas self-shielding in virialized regions.
