We also find no VLM binary systems (defined\nhere as systems with M_tot<0.185 solar masses) with separations >15 AU.\n  We briefly explore possible reasons why VLM binaries are slightly less\ncommon, nearly equal mass, and much more tightly bound compared to more massive\nbinaries. We find that a kick during the ejection of a forming VLM binary from\na close triple or quadruple encounter (imparting a differential kick of ~3 km/s\nbetween the members of the binary) could reproduce the observed cut-off in the\nsemi-major axis distribution at ~20 AU. However, the estimated binarity (~<5%;\nBate et al. 2002) produced by such \"ejection scenarios\" is below the 9-15%\nobserved. Similarly, the dynamical decay models of Sterzik & Durisen (1998);\nDurisen, Sterzik, & Pickett (2001) also cannot produce a VLM binary fraction\nabove ~5%. Our estimate of a fragmentation-produced VLM binary semi-major axis\ndistribution contains a significant fraction of ``wide'' VLM binaries with a>20\nAU in contrast to observation. Hence more detailed theoretical work will be\nneeded to explain this very interesting VLM binary population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jan 2003 23:36:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

As in the\ncase of solitary, non millisecond pulsars, an X-ray detection represents the\nfirst step for a follow-up identification campaign in the optical. Among the\nX-ray detected millisecond pulsars, PSR J2124-3358 stands out as an ideal case\nbecause it is very close (<270 pc) and little absorbed. Here, we report on\nrecent VLT observations of the PSR J2124-3358 aimed at the identification of\nits optical counterpart. No optical emission from the pulsar has been detected\ndown to a limiting flux of V ~ 27.8.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jan 2003 13:09:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Jan 2003 12:52:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

In physics we find that discrete symmetries frequently arise as\n`internal', non-spacetime symmetries. Permutation symmetry is such a discrete\nsymmetry arising as the mathematical basis underlying the statistical behaviour\nof ensembles of certain types of indistinguishable quantum particle (e.g.,\nfermions and bosons). Roughly speaking, if such an ensemble is invariant under\na permutation of its constituent particles (i.e., permutation symmetric) then\none doesn't `count' those permutations which merely `exchange'\nindistinguishable particles; rather, the exchanged state is identified with the\noriginal state. This principle of invariance is generally called the\n`indistinguishability postulate' [IP], but we prefer to use the term\n`permutation invariance' [PI]. It is this symmetry principle that is typically\ntaken to underpin and explain the nature of (fermionic and bosonic) quantum\nstatistics (although, as we shall see, this characterisation is not\nuncontentious), and it is this principle that has important consequences\nregarding the metaphysics of identity and individuality for particles\nexhibiting such statistical behaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jan 2003 13:27:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
