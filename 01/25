In the\ncase of strong XPM coupling, DW configurations contain a single mode at each\nend of the chain. The most fundamental solution of this type is found to be\nalways stable. Another solution, which is generated by a different AC pattern,\ndemonstrates behavior which is unusual for nonlinear dynamical lattices: it is\nunstable for small values of the coupling constant $C$ (which measures the\nratio of the nonlinearity and coupling lengths), and becomes stable at larger\n$C$. Stable bound states of DWs are also found. DW configurations generated by\nmore sophisticated AC patterns are identified as well, but they are either\ncompletely unstable, or are stable only at small values of $C$. In the case of\nweak XPM, a natural DW solution is the one which contains a combination of both\npolarizations, with the phase difference between them 0 and $\\pi $ at the\nopposite ends of the lattice. This solution is unstable at all values of $C$,\nbut the instability is very weak for large $C$, indicating stabilization as the\ncontinuum limit is approached. The stability of DWs is also verified by direct\nsimulations, and the evolution of unstable DWs is simulated too; in particular,\nit is found that, in the weak-XPM system, the instability may give rise to a\nmoving DW.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jan 2003 15:09:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
